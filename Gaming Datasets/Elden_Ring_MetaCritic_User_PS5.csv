HKaganDem,I can't understand those who say 2022 god of war was right. God of war is never a bad game but it is very faithful to its essence. Elden ring is a game that feels both innovative and great.,10,2025-01-01,PLAYSTATION 5
Jogherd,"The first souls game ever that I had the nerves and energy to finish. It's not bad, that's for sure. But like all the souls games it is insanely overhyped in my opinion. For a 10/10 open world game there are too many things missing. There might be a story, but after 60 hours of play time I have pretty much no idea of what was happening other than me becoming the ""Elden Lord"" after slaying about 40 bosses with the same jump attack strategy. Also I don't think it's an indicator **** single player game when I have to read ten guides online and watch multiple youtube videos in order to understand the builds or basically how almost anything in this game even works on a basic level. Would give this a 7/10 but will give it a 6 to counteract the crazy fanboyism and overhype from so many people here.",6,2024-12-31,PLAYSTATION 5

DasBooty,"This is the most disgustingly overrated game I've played in 25 years of gaming. It's a janky, dated, uninspired dark souls rip off - there are 10,000,000 games identical to this. The only reason anyone likes this is because Elon Musk told them to. It's a pointless, boring, poorly made, the graphics looks straight out of 2012 and the combat feels like **** compared to other dark souls rip offs like Wu Kong.",1,2024-12-29,PLAYSTATION 5
cylentstorm,"Elden Ring carries the ""Souls"" legacy into a visually-appealing open world that practically begs to be explored. The inclusion of the same tedious combat mechanics and clunky interface from earlier games is disappointing, but if you've never played one of FROM's artificially difficult hack-and-slash action titles, then ER is probably the most inviting entry point. Ignore the incoherent ""story"" and lack of helpful information in-game, crack open a wiki, and prepare to die many deaths before you find a playstyle that works for you. There is fun to be found in Elden Ring, but digging it up can take some serious effort, a varied approach, and all too many hours of repetitive game loops.",7,2024-12-29,PLAYSTATION 5
Wawarabe,"Un des mes jeux préférés. Je l'ai fait à plusieurs reprises. L'œuvre de Miyazaki nous plonge dans un jeux vidéos riches sur tout les plans. Tout d'abord, on peut citer la bande-son qui est subliminal, on peut notamment faire référence à l'OST du combat de radahn, radagon ou encore Godfrey. De même,Hidetaka Miyazaki expose ici aux joueurs un lore énorme composé d'un nombre incalculable de détails, comme le passé de l'univers avec les Dragons-Anciens et Placidusax le seigneur des dragons. On apprend une immensité de chose à travers le lore comme l'assassinat de Godwyn commit par Ranni, l'histoire de Vyke, les malédiction des 3 enfants issus de Marika et Radagon. Bref, tout ce que j'ai cité ne définit même pas 1% du lore. Aussi, le gameplay est très bien gérer pour le joueur, la manière dont le jeu force l'apprentissage des paternes en créer une satisfaction, de même on peut compter un nombre incalculable d'armes, de sorts et pleins d'autres mécaniques. La manière dont les combats sont fait génère un dynamisme de gameplay. Les quêtes sont multiples et intéressantes mais assez mal guidés, mais cela fait partie de l'essence même des souls. Les graphismes sont pas révolutionnaire mais celle-ci est en cohésion avec le design du jeu qui en fait de lui un jeu magnifique. En autre, Elden Ring possède un nombre incalculable de points positifs qui prendrait un temps fou à citer. Une expérience à vivre.",10,2024-12-26,PLAYSTATION 5
fake_nikpap,"TLDR: Yes the game is amazing, with epic fights, a larger scale to its story and with really tough endgame bosses!This game is everything fans loved about the series but brought to the open world. The combat feels as good as ever, with quick responses to your inputs and nice flow and feeling of weight overall. With a variety of classes to choose from, and playstyles that suit every player this game can be as easy or as hard as you want it to be. From summons to spirit NPC ashes, you can choose whether to fight solo or with an ally. There is one bossfight where I definitely recommend using summons and that's the Godskin Duo. Now on the story side of ****'S MINDBLOWNLINGLY EPIC! Overall it makes you feel like you're rising up to the top becoming stronger and stronger, culminating in an epic final **** the negatives now...Some classes and builds are way better than others, making fights hilariously easy but again that's up to the player. I didn't involve myself in the PVP so no comments on that. A lot of assets are re-used but I kind of expected that in a game as massive as this. Lastly, a lot of the bosses in the late game are really hard, not allowing the player with a window of opportunity for a counter attack and with endgame damage stats, the fights become really hard and are a matter of patience. But overall I don't have anything major to say in regard to the bad aspects of the ****: The music in certain bossfights just gives me chills(Mohg, Lord of Blood cough cough)",10,2024-12-26,PLAYSTATION 5

LobbyGott,"Elden Ring ist ein Meisterwerk, das die Grenzen des Open-World-Genres neu definiert. FromSoftware hat mit diesem Spiel ein Universum geschaffen, das so lebendig und detailreich ist, dass man sich stundenlang darin verlieren kann. Die Welt ist voller Geheimnisse, die es zu entdecken gilt, und die Lore ist so tiefgründig, dass sie immer wieder neue Interpretationen zulässt. Das Spielerlebnis ist herausfordernd, aber fair. Jeder Sieg fühlt sich verdient an und trägt dazu bei, dass man sich mit seiner Spielfigur identifizieren kann. Die Bosskämpfe sind episch und fordern sowohl Geschick als auch Geduld.

Akko7721,You will spend 8 hours trying to leave the starting area and never get anywhere. I can honestly say this is the worst game I've ever spent money on and I can't say enough bad things about it.,0,2024-12-24,PLAYSTATION 5
Pixelmunky,"I really wanted to like this game, but just 5 hours in all I can say is that I regret buying it (although I got it on sale, it still stings). - Story feels non-existent - Atmosphere is depressing - No music while you play - Progression is super slow - Graphics look old - Loot drops are 99% garbage - Controls and inventory management are poor - Crafting is pointless - Armour and Weapon upgrades don’t matter - Combat is slow and clunky - Open world feels empty - Game feels hard on purpose to mask that it’s not a fun game - Boss fights are fun, but that’s about it All you do is go around killing things to save up “Runes” (XP) to cash in for levelling up, and you never actually feel any stronger. I have 5 hours into it, watched a few hours of videos to see if I was “missing something” or “not playing it properly”, and can quite confidently say this game isn’t for me, and I can’t understand why it won GOTY and gets such high review scores. I guess games journalists just don’t represent me any more, given the last few years.",1,2024-12-23,PLAYSTATION 5

Takotes,"Elden ring has good world design, tons of content, great customization, but really poor boss fights and mini dungeons that weigh it down for a solo player. If you enjoyed previous fromsoft games you’ll likely enjoy most of what Elden ring has to offer, especially early on. The World is just enormous compared to previous titles in terms of space and easily on par in terms of zones. The combat is very similar with new special moves added to allow for greater variety and speed. The zones are generally fun to explore (albeit the size makes the main open world zones tedious). The legacy dungeons are fun and interesting with branching and puzzles. Bosses are largely just not fun to fight. They are far too aggressive unless you use multiplayer/summons which tend to make them easier than you would like. This leads to you either spending time waiting out combos to look for a tiny opening window where you don’t have time to use most interesting skills or to hit them while their attention is on someone else. The latter doesn’t give much satisfaction to many players. Mini dungeons have the same problem as chalice dungeons from blood borne. They all feel samey and boring with a few exceptions. NPC quest lines are enjoyable, but difficult to find and follow in the open world. Overall there’s a lot to enjoy, but I personally feel like the game drags really badly the later you get with boss fights getting more frequent. Each successive one just wears rather than brings joy. I’ve not gotten this feeling from any other fromsoft title, nor many of the more popular Derivative titles. In the end you’ll get your money’s worth of fun and playtime, but may end up with a bitter feeling about it.",6,2024-12-22,PLAYSTATION 5

Emprite,"This game isn’t a master piece like everyone says. It has a few BIG problems. For example your character moves like in demon souls, yet the bosses move like it’s sekiro. (Which by the way sekiro is objectively THE best fromsoft game. It has a focused and rewarding system (the parry system) along with a new element, the grapple. If I took every fromsoft game and stripped the color from them and put them side by side you would not be able to tell the difference. Except sekiro. now the next problem is the game doesn’t actually improve at all? It seems they spent three years just making the map? Lmao. I was expecting something as unique and as fun as sekiro OR something as refined as lies of p. LoP is also the second best fromsoft game, that’s not made by fromsoft. The only really negative reviews on the game are just saying it’s more of a “refinement not an improvement” or that “they copied fromsoft” and fromsoft copied ninja gaiden. What’s your point? that’s exactly what it is, and it does it extremely well. Lies of p takes Essentially the best thing from every from soft game and puts it in one game. Along with a more understandable story and its own unique theme and gameplay/ combat systems. I was expecting far more out of Elden ring yet it falls short unfortunately. I tried playing the game so many times and I really just tried to like it, but it’s simply a literal copy and paste of DS3. That goes for pretty much most fromsoft games. If you have played one fromsoft game, you basically played them all. And unfortunately they are the most toxic players in video games if you try to tell them that they’re buying the same game every year like COD, they will gang up and you and start **** on each other lol. Proof of this is the success of lies of p. round8 studio made a game far better than pretty much anything put out by fromsoft and the only people hating were fromsoft ****. We all know if from soft put out lies of P they would be praising and **** it off lol. They buy the same game every year. Then turn around and make fun of Ubisoft and Activision….. The irony lol. In Elden ring especially Malenia. she has a certain move set called the waterfall dance or something like that. She and a few others are a perfect example of poorly made game decisions and boss moveset. That certain movement is CLEARLY A copy out of sekiro and meant to be parryied, yet it’s not parryable. They essentially copied boss moves from sekiro, giving bosses, sekiro boss like movement and patterns. while giving the actual player dark souls 1 movement you see similar problems in one of the most recent call of duty games, And why copying things from other games doesn’t always work. In the newest Mw3 2023 they took over a decade old maps that is designed with positioning and slow movement in mind from the OG mw2 and ported it in a game where you get across the map in literally 4 seconds….. essentially destroying any actually positioning or strongholds on the map. That would be the main fight locations for players. And this goes for every map. Was really excited, expecting something NEW from fromsoftware like sekiro. Unfortunately this is what we got. Not to mention game looks like a early ps4 game or late ps3 game. The game also plays in 60fps on ps5, but for some reason the game looks like it moves in a choppy 40. Like it’s having microstutters or something. It’s probably their engine as it feels they have been using the same ps3 engine the whole time or something. Overall it’s not a bad game, but realistically it’s a 7-8/10",7,2024-12-19,PLAYSTATION 5

I love how this game is like Dark Souls but also more adventure-y. The exploring part is my favorite part of this game, if you choose to just explore that one random part of the cave, you might just find an interesting piece of lore about the world of Elden Ring, or if you choose to explore the dungeons that are the catacombs, you will find other interesting pieces about the world.

safferey,"i initially got elden ring from my friend back in january, and like most people i got mad and quit after 1 session. when i redownloaded the game 10 months later, i gave it a real shot, and i just recently 100% beat the game on steam. this games lore is phenomenal, some of fromsoft's best. i loved my first playthrough so much, i did it 4 more times, and im on ng+5 with the same character with 111 hours of playtime. every ending was great (lord of frenzied flame included) and the questlines to get the individual ones were amazing. my only complaint is you dont get a great sense of direction through the game, with no quest bar or something to indicate where you need to go or who you need to meet. some could argue it adds intrigue to the game, but for me it just made it a bit more confusing. nevertheless, i had a wonderful time with elden ring and if its on sale or you're looking for a challenge, i implore you to buy it",9,2024-12-04,PLAYSTATION 5
JimTR,"Elden ringwas the missing piece in my puzzle while I had played FromSoftware games before I just couldnt bring myself to like them. Until this masterpiece released it had everything exploration,lore,variety and amazing level and character design. Of course by being an open world game it means that the Tarnished can explore almost every bit of the map making any boss easier by finding just the right gear.

creastez,"Após concluir e platinar Elden Ring, posso afirmar com convicção que este é, sem dúvida, um dos melhores jogos que já tive a oportunidade de jogar. Elden Ring transcendeu minhas expectativas, especialmente ao demonstrar como uma história pode ser narrada de maneira envolvente mesmo quando não é apresentada de forma convencional. A integração entre narrativa e cenários, seja no aspecto visual ou temático, impacta diretamente a experiência de jogo, elevando-a a um nível excepcional. Cada batalha, escolha de estilo de jogo, e construção de personagens (como builds e abordagens estratégicas) foram projetadas para proporcionar uma experiência verdadeiramente única.O aspecto que mais me impressionou foi a incrível capacidade do jogo de combinar variedade e qualidade. Não conheço outro título que consiga executar essa integração de maneira tão magistral. A trilha sonora, direção artística, design de cenários, criaturas e personagens não jogáveis (NPCs) mantêm um padrão extraordinário de excelência. Elden Ring não apenas oferece diversidade em conteúdo, mas também assegura que cada elemento esteja à altura da qualidade esperada de uma obra-prima.

WorthTheWait,"Elden Ring is a beautiful game that is well designed and filled a refined level of polish and care, there are many aspects of this game that the average developer would never even consider in terms of creating an open world of this scale and filling it with this many meaningful interactions, exploratory rewards and overall gameplay feel, however where they fell through was with the lack of idle animations. The player character (Tarnished) has no idle animation for when people walk away from the their controller although the game istelf is filled with a number of animations for the tarnished to be able to complete at the press of a button a lack of idle waiting animation to help characterize the tarnished or at least as a small flourish for the player is abysmal especially considering the fact that this game is filled with a number of small things that many would overlook in such a large game.

Bahia8000,"Elden ring is good but not really all that great. In a lot of ways it feels like an extended version of dark souls 2, not saying that dark souls 2 is bad, but that it overstays its welcome. Art direction is hit or miss, sometimes when you stand in edges of hills and mountains you can see a beatiful world, but when you are actually going trough it there is so many problems, not just that it can seem sameish, but that it has a lot of unecesary things such as chromatic aberration, bad upscaler (ps5), motion blur, film grain (or its the upscaler); all of this things also make other bad effects, such as ghosting, and it has 1000 problems with illumination, halo effects on many cirmustances, progresive shadow generation seen in Fallout 4 on the console versions, weird lighting issue where on the center of the screen there is more detail/correct detail whereas left or right there is less. The drawing distances also are laughable and really breaks the inmersion, specially so on liurna and limgrave. Art is there and its good but its shadowed by many decisions, issues, technical problems and player guidance Gameplay wise, its the same thing as in dark souls but with a few things that i dislike. Shields shouldnt have the counter attack thing only when blocked, it makes many battles trivial, i would have preffered that you can just normally attack back, simple but nice. A lot of the cool spells are actually bad and a lot of the boring ones, such as throwing a big rock are infinitely more useful than transforming into a 3 headed dragon that unleashes a breath of fire everywhere. Jumping in combat is way too inconsitstent, sometimes you can jump the attacks, other times you cant. Exploration wise, i miss the more unorthodox ways of parkouring seen in dark souls 1, here there is a couple but they arent nearly as good and creative as other games seen in fromsoftware. The open world fails to guide most players truly properly and some places are way bigger than they should be, making them confusing and neverending, especially a problem if you are a guy which likes to explore everything for loot, but you are met with like 15 ways to go each going into 4 ways, making me stressed about losing something. Personally i did not have issues with difficulty, if anything it felt on the easier side of general games with very few exceptions (such as malenia), many people say about a difficulty spike, which i probably did not experience because of my kind of completionist playthrougs, but can be an issue if you dont have the eye or patience or time. Bosses and general enemies are the most dissapointing thing honestly, they have good variety and all, some designs are good but the choreography which i really loved in souls saga, here it doesnt make any sense, most attacks are completly useless to do in real life, why would you expose yourself for like 5 seconds before attacking, you want to be knocked down?, this happened in the souls saga but not nearly as much as here, it wasnt the norm but it is here now, its artifially difficult. Weapon variety is nice, only issue is that there should be an easier way to compare lower level weapons to higher level ones, more ways to test it without sacrificing 70 thousand materials just to see if its better or not Lore is good, story itself kinda ****, its poorly told to the player and you have to make more of an effort to understand, in DS3 each piece of clothing and every weapon had a good enough description to tell a lot of whats happening, here most weapons descriptions are: swords, used by the guy you just killed. Some npcs where actually interesting, most where kinda lame and you never really know anyone intentions, nor whats trully happening in the world nor who is good or bad, it doesnt help that english translation was bad enough to make a good character seem like a genocidical creature. Overall its not bad, if you loved souls you will like this, it isnt necesarily hard, and if you **** a lot in games, you can use all the help you can get which is actually the point of the game.",7,2024-11-17,PLAYSTATION 5

Fyxhcl,"Elden Ring is a open world game based on the gameplay of Souls games. Playing as a custom character, you'll be thrown inside an huge world full of mysteries and dangerous enemies.With an action gameplay and using mostly white weapons and magic, you'll have to explore the map, upgrade your character, survive and find and kill all bosses, all with little to no guidance from the game.Every fight and every enemy could be quite challenging, and dying and repeating over and over the same fight or dungeon is something that's supposed to happen pretty often. Anyway, any death is usually caused by some recognizable mistake and repetition after repetition the player will understand how to avoid them and succeed. The difficult can be annoying and frustating for some player, but at the same time, it's also what makes the game very satisfying. There is no difficulty setting, but the game gives to the player several tools that make the game easier, like evocations, buffs etc. and learning how to use them will make the game easier for non-hardcore **** open world is probably the most amazing feature of the game, it's huge and full of things to do, of places to explore and of secrets to uncover. The curiosity to see what's in the next area will probably never abandon you, since the world is very varied and interesting. Personally, after exploring the first area and the first legacy dungeon, I was really excited to explore the rest of the game and see what was there, and I must say I was not disappointed (except maybe for the last region).Does this game also have flaws? Yes, absolutely: the gameplay is repetitive, just explore the dungeons and kill enemies. The plot is obscure and can be understood only by reading it from the internet. Sometimes you won't know where to go, or why go somewhere. The side quests can be completed only reading a guide because they're few and not explained at all (talk with a character, now go in this specific place that you already explored and have no reason to go to again, and talk with him again to continue the quest). Most of the dungeons will give you rewards that you don't need (usually weapons that you cannot use with your build) and the most you'll play the game, the most you'll see reused content: same style of dungeons in each region, reused bosses or minibosses, a dragon in each region, etc. This content is still enjoyable but at same point you'll notice you aren't anymore encountering anything new. The worst offender is the last region of the game, which is pretty empty compared to the others, and I believe don't have a single unique enemy.Despite all this flaws, I believe the game is still a 10. The size, the cure of many details, the neat gameplay, the beautifulness of the game world, the fascinating atmosphere and the difficult but fair challenge make this game a masterpiece. Maybe it's not for everyone, but if you know you like this kind of games, Elden Ring is without a doubt one of the best games you can play.",10,2024-11-20,PLAYSTATION 5
CupoMescitore,"I am not a hardcore fan of From Software. In fact, I loved Bloodborne and Sekiro but I've never been able to fall in love for Dark Souls series even if I love dark fantasy worlds. Elder Ring is the pinnacle of the artistic view of Miyazaki and FromSoftware and it's a Masterpiece. Period. They've been able to condese all the experiences of previous work in a gem of pure artistic value. Everyhting is magistrally conceived: artistic direction, music, level desing, gameplay, combat system, freedom for the player, lore, dialogs, everithing. The exploring experience is so rewarding and stimulating that everytime you face difficulties and obstacles you know that there will be a reward at the end. If you like FromSoft works and RPG you must play it, if you are new to them is the best starting point.",10,2024-11-18,PLAYSTATION 5
Class-vip,"Elden Ring is a true masterpiece, a game of breathtaking beauty, rich in content and incredibly challenging. The experience is both rewarding and demanding, with gameplay mechanics that constantly push the player’s limits, while offering moments of rare intensity. While the progression can be tough and at times painful, each victory, no matter how small, brings immense satisfaction. After more than 150 hours of gameplay, there is still so much to discover, which speaks to the unprecedented depth of the Elden Ring world. FromSoftware manages to captivate and challenge its players while offering complete freedom of exploration. An essential game that redefines the modern RPG experience.",10,2024-11-17,PLAYSTATION 5

ABroome,"Words cannot describe the beauty and danger of this world. As a newbie to the souls series I didn’t know what I was getting into, but I was pleasantly blown away. The first steps into this world are breath taking and each player only experiences it once, when you first see the size of this world with the beautiful tree in the distance, while it is also surrounded by a torn and twisted world its very compelling. The thought of new comers to this game is usually: this is massive, because at every step of your journey in this game the world gets bigger and bigger often times that’s from a physical perspective but also the story tied in with it get more and more expansive as you go, everything has a a story, everything has a purpose. Now to the problems people have with this game, yes it is a long game and yes it is difficult and unforgiving and every turn can easily spell death, but even that tells a story about how dark this world is, it makes those times that you’re walking and taking in the scenery that much more special when you’re not dying. With the difficulty, fromsoft is known for their difficult battles and bosses, but Elden Ring does something incredible: there are many ways you can make the game easier, as a new comer I got stuck on the first important boss and it made me upset so I stopped playing for months, soon I came back and researched the game more, and found strategy and skill a thing that a lot of games lack, I learned how to upgrade and build my character, how to dodge and time my attacks. Yes it takes time and dedication, but giving up won’t make you any better. From a newcomer struggling with this game I changed the way I looked at it and now I have completed the game and beat the hardest boss plus the whole dlc, the reason I say that is because anyone can do it not just the diehard figure it out souls fans. If you’re lost get some help but try and figure it out before you jump to the internet, but if you need one single item to complete your build don’t comb the whole world for it, drop the ego and get help, the Elden Ring community is astounding; from lore studying theorists to hero’s that lend a hand to help other players beat a tough boss, and what brings us together is the victory afterwards, the messages of despair at the entrance of boss gates are met with messages of victory at the end of the boss and it’s all that more satisfying to be the one who did it. It’s okay if you don’t get it the first try, just don’t give up quickly. Lastly, the lore. The story telling in the game is amazing, there’s so many questions that are often times satisfying when they’re left unanswered so we can let our minds wander, every boss, every enemy, every item, every weapon has a purpose for being where it is and doing what it does, many enemies that you’ve seen in other places with have different powers or weapons due to the location they’re in or what they’ve been through, nothing ever gets old. In all Elden Ring IS a Masterpiece and I have never enjoyed a video game as much as I have enjoyed this one, it even disappoints me to see it not ranked higher on the list of best video games of all time. This game has changed gaming forever.",10,2024-11-16,PLAYSTATION 5

Argonaut1993,Such an incredible game that just built off of dark souls 3’s combat and made it even better. The open world is vast and fun. Combat is amazing and the bosses are very well designed and exciting to fight. My only gripe is that you can’t just invade unless someone has either summoned an ally to aid them or has put on the taunters tongue (which few people do) so it feels like the odds are always stacked against the invader. However that is a minor gripe considering how great the game is and how much extra things they have given us in the patches such as the area. Big fan of this genre and highly recommended,9,2024-11-13,PLAYSTATION 5

TeeMoz734,"Elden Ring is a dream come true for a long time Souls and Bloodborne fan. The landscapes, atmosphere, music, combat and enemies are all fantastically tuned and crafted. Elden Ring gives the player a sense of joy and reward when finally overcoming the challenge they are faced with, which is exactly what soulsborne games should focus on. The boss arenas do an excellent job of displaying how a character should be perceived as well as how they are they way they are with the music added as well on top pushes that feeling to an even greater level, a personal favourite being the Godskin Duo arena with it’s accompanying soundtrack. The lore is vibrant and at times does get confusing but the search for the truth of the lore reinvigorates another run through of the entire game time and time again looking for any further morsel I may have missed. In conclusion Elden Ring has brought together several elements that show a dedication and passion to their respective departments as well as the tenacity to not leave until it was almost perfect. This is what games within the next couple of years should strive to be like in terms of quality and polish.",9,2024-11-11,PLAYSTATION 5

AMillionNinjas,"I bought this game on the day it released, having been anticipating it for years. I still to this day have no beat it, and yet I’ve never once uninstalled it from my PS5. Why? Because the game is a work of true love for gaming, expert craftsmanship, and has one of the most beautiful, terrifying, and immersive worlds ever created. But that world is gigantic, it is harrowing, it is intimidating. I go back to Elden Ring every so often, usually a few times a month to try and FINALLY chip away at it and beat it (finally uninstalling it will be a personal holiday for me), and I’ve loved every single second of it. I’m in the latter half of the DLC now, and once I finish that, I’m fully set to fight the final boss in the main game. I’ve platinumed it up to this point, which I NEVER do for games. After 300 hours, I can safely say it’s one of the greatest works of art ever created.",10,2024-11-08,PLAYSTATION 5

LesMiserables,I already had souls fatigue by the time I finished the DLC of Dark Souls 3 so it certainly didn't help that Elden Ring is essentially Dark Souls 3 with a jump function and a janky horse set in an open world . Said open world is HIGHLY overrated because it's mostly filled with crap bosses and crap dungeons that get recycled often . Can you skip them? Not really because without a guide you won't know where essential items or weapons are and many times they are hidden in these dungeons or they are given as rewards . Speaking of which good luck completing side quests without a guide . Boss fights beyond a certain point are just annoying to deal with and most normal people will just abuse some exploit they read online in order to beat them,5,2023-12-20,PLAYSTATION 5

The dungeons in this game are amazing and the main bosses are nothing short of amazing. The combat is also SO GOOD, just like any other souls game. I didn't really care for the story as i was playing because it is really not too interesting in my opinion. Thankfully i don't care about story in games so i still love this game so much. There are some flaws though, like the aforementioned repetition of content. The world can also feel a bit empty at times, but that's a problem for many open world games, not just this one. Also, you can over-level before fighting a boss, making the fight extremely easy. Overall, amazing game, would recommend.",9,2024-11-04,PLAYSTATION 5

Ciò che lascia senza parola è la mappa che nonostante la sua mastodonticita, un po' grazie all'attenzione data dagli sviluppatori e un po' grazie alla scheda grafica di Playstation 5, presenta infiniti dettagli in ognuna delle regioni presenti che durante l'avventura mi hanno fatto spesso perdere nel loro vasto territorio fatto anche di rompicapi che non fanno mai male.

O jogo não possui algum guia ou uma maneira de se encontrar, te joga num mundo imenso e feio. Me pergunto como a mesma franquia de Dark Souls 3 e Bloodborne caiu nisso, o design desses jogos são incríveis enquanto de Elden Ring é uma poluição visual e confuso. Unica coisa boa em Elden Ring é o combate, porém n adianta nada, as batalhas ou são curtas e chatas, ou são longas e exaustiva.

Everything is done right: the exploration, the gameplay, the bosses, the environments, the lore and its characters, the music... It offers a great level of challenge but beating a hard boss is very satisfying (the difficulty is also ""adjustable"" to your own liking thanks to the rune system) and when you die you know it's your fault.

It looks great but the gameplay makes you question if the fromsoft devs have been replaced by some outsourced studio. The progression and exploration is full of repetative, copy pasted trash, most the game is just spent running around empty spaces, most bossfights are horrible compared to dark souls 3, etc.. i dont know how this got released, very disappointed.",5,2024-09-22,PLAYSTATION 5

EndlessGrief,"""Elden Ring"" is a masterpiece of open-world design, blending FromSoftware's signature challenging combat with a vast, visually stunning world. The freedom to explore and discover at your own pace is one of the game's greatest strengths, and the sense of adventure is unparalleled. The variety in enemies, locations, and bosses, especially in the early and mid-game, keeps the experience fresh and exciting. However, after reaching the capital, the game starts to lose some of its momentum. The pacing slows down significantly, with the map feeling overly large and increasingly empty. Recycled enemies and bosses, particularly in the later areas, feel like reskinned versions of earlier encounters, reducing the sense of discovery and excitement that defines the earlier parts of the game. These issues lead to a less engaging endgame, where exploration begins to feel more like a chore than an adventure. Despite these drawbacks, ""Elden Ring"" remains a deeply rewarding and immersive experience overall. Its incredible world design, challenging combat, and the thrill of exploration still make it one of the best action RPGs of its kind, even if the post-capital sections could benefit from more variety and tighter design.",9,2024-09-06,PLAYSTATION 5

At the moment, I'm mainly focused on the story and easy and accessible gameplay (i'm 42, wife, two kids;). But this...doesn't fulfill anything in the above sentence, it's different. I don't know much about the plot, and the game is difficult, but it's addictive as hell. Beautiful world, great combat and guess what, you can choose the difficulty level, which makes it easier due to the open world. All you need is the right approach and the use of facilities (ghosts) added by the creators. Don't be afraid to start the adventure, it's worth it, don't give up and you will be rewarded.

micbrabr,"Meu jogo favorito, Elden Ring mescla desafio, recompensa, uma experiencia de mundo aberto extremamente desafiadora e um grande sentimento de satisfação ao derrotar a Elden Beast no final. Esse jogo inova o gênero Souls, com gráficos de última geração e o tão esperado mundo aberto, atingindo, a meu ver o ""teto"", do gênero. É quase impossível de ser superado. No quesito qualidade, foi o melhor jogo lançado nos últimos 10 anos(2012-2022), e seguramente um dos 10 melhores já lançados em todos os tempos. É engraçado que, olhando cada aspecto individualmente, Elden Ring não é o melhor em quase nada: Em trilha sonora é desbancado por Dark Souls 3 e Red Dead Redemption 2, embora fique com a terceira posição, em combate está em segundo lugar, atrás apenas de Sekiro, em dificuldade está atrás de vários: Dark Souls 2, Sekiro, Black Myth Wukong, em mundo é o terceiro atrás de Skyrim e Red Dead Redemption 2, em história perde para Zelda e Red Dead Redemption 2, mas fica em terceiro, mas independentemente disso, em todas as categorias ele está entre os melhores. Portanto, eu considero Elden Ring o melhor jogo na média, pois embora não seja o melhor em quase nada(ele é o melhor em exploração e recompensa), por sempre ficar entre os 5 melhores em todas as categorias que se possa analisar(exceto gráficos, onde tem vários melhores), ele consegue se destacar como o melhor por ser pelo menos um dos 3 ou 4 melhores jogos em todos os prismas que se possa analisar. Uma experiencia obrigatória para qualquer jogador.",10,2024-09-02,PLAYSTATION 5
Quentinho4,"Un des meilleurs jeu solo de tous les temps? Subjectivement, je le crois. Une véritable ode à l'aventure, l'exploration, la curiosité, le réflexion et la persévérance. C'est le seul jeu qui a été capable, depuis que je suis adulte, à me faire vivre les mêmes émotions, le même émerveillement et la même curiosité qu'un jeu pouvait me faire ressentir dans mon enfance. C'est pour vous dire à quel le point le jeu est marquant et impactant. Lorsque adulte, un jeu arrive à vous captiver de la sorte, c'est que vous êtes en face d'un chef d'oeuvre. En effet il est plus compliqué de surprendre, rendre curieux, impressionner, challenger, rendre accro un adulte qu'un enfant. Enfant le moindre jeu pouvait nous émerveiller et nous faire y penser avant de dormir et en se réveillant par hâte d'y jouer. En bref Elden ring est de loin un 10+/10. Les notes négatives ne viennent que de gens, incapables de surmonter la difficulté, trop peu curieux ou des fameuses personnes qui adorent penser à contre-courant et remettre en doute l'opinion publique. FONCEZ sur ce jeu, tout y est presque parfait, exploration, level design, DA, Lore, bestiaire, boss, musiques, zones, items, secrets, cinématiques etc... L'aboutissement ultime du savoir faire de Fromsoftware malgré les dires des nostalgiques et puristes. Seul défaut du jeu à mon goût, le reskin de trop de boss secondaires, pour un deuxième opus, réduire le nombre de miniboss pour les rendre plus unique ne serait pas de refus.",10,2024-06-04,PLAYSTATION 5

ChrisCGN,"Awesome game. I don't think I need to say too much about it. What I do not like about it: Difficulty. Yes, many say this has to be but I disagree. However, after some time you tend to like some of the hard battles. For example, the fight against Malenia really makes fun and you think about making this harder for you. In the end it is all about what Level you have. So if you waste enough Lifetime farming runes, you can enter easy mode. This is not really good. Second thing I do not like is the Quest mechanics. You can easy miss something. A little bit more info would be nice. Apart from this, the game is really awesome. To me most important and best thing is the Level design. Without spoiling I just can say there is a lot to explore! To me this is clearly a must play game.",8,2024-09-01,PLAYSTATION 5

Boco399956,艾尔登法环》实质上是《黑暗之魂》系列的续作，重开IP的原因是为了方便丁自由的创作世界观，因此游戏在玩法上的核心机制基本都是《黑魂》的延续和拓展。除了大家熟悉的闪避、背刺、盾反，新加入的跳跃机制在本作中有着浓墨重彩的戏份，潜行机制在也十分好用。在褪色者长出膝盖后，几乎大部分的Boss都加入了攻击范围巨大的地面技能，只会滚地板的话战斗难度会大幅提升。同时本作引入了“失去平衡”的设定，R2的蓄力攻击和X+R2的跳劈能够快速积累类似《只狼》的架势条，从而触发处决，因此这几乎是所有玩家必须掌握的技巧，不过好在难度比起盾反和枪反都要低不少。跳跃机制的存在也使得大型主城的内部构造变得更加立体，玩家可以凭借屋顶和墙壁跳过大片敌人密集的区域，直接来到BOSS面前。战灰代替了以往的质变宝石，不但能够在赐福处改变武器的属性，还能够为武器绑定新的战技。战灰还能反复使用和复制，有很多类似卡利亚大剑这样帅气度和实用程度兼备的存在；法术方面，受智力影响的辉石魔法，和受信仰影响的祷告都十分强力，视觉效果的华丽程度也是空前的；四十多种灵魂能够有效降低Boss战难度，在这里也点名表扬一路随我征战的狗薪王们。如果你是一个爱看风景的不死人，一定能在交界地里大饱眼福。当我夜晚骑着灵马走在湖之利耶尼亚的原野，缓缓抬头是星辰铺满的银河，一轮皓月挂在巍峨的黄金树枝头；当电梯缓缓沉入希芙拉河的井底，地底世界的紫色星空也美到精心动魄；在孤悬在峭壁之底，似乎是罐子哥家乡的壶村，则是一派宁静美好的景象，让甚至不忍心摘走小罐罐们围着跳舞的花；盖利德原野上，红狮子城的士兵们正在与猩红腐 败滋生的怪物浴血奋战。或许正是因为开放世界给与了足够的创作空间，From Software在紧贴剧情主轴的前提下，毫不保留地展示着多年积攒的美术功底和通过环境来讲故事的能力。,10,2024-08-19,PLAYSTATION 5

It doesn't feel like it has repetitive game play, boss battles are extremely hard but I just go and level up for a hour then I'm good. I don't know why exactly this game is so good but I can't stop playing it. Beautiful looking game and voice acting is good.

MasterGruber,"100+ hours in the game and I have completed many of the previous From Soft Souls games (Demon Souls, Dark Souls 1-3, Blood Borne, and Sekiro). This is the first of these types of games that I was disappointed in it. I really wanted to like this one and gave it the best chance I could, but in the end, I do not like it and do not recommend it to anyone who has not already played a From Soft Souls game. For those that have played some of the other games, I can only recommend this if 1) you prefer to use a guide when playing these games (it is not crafted to be played and story understood without one for this From Soft game in particular); 2) you do not mind spending time running around on a horse/ goat trying to find locations and items; 3) are willing to spend a very long time on your first playthrough. To make this review short, the game improved on the combat mechanics of its predecessors. However, the open world made this game boring, the horse/goat disincentivized fighting enemies and bosses not in dungeons, the dungeons themselves were underdeveloped and lackluster in regard to enemy placement, branching pathways with little to no rewards. The weapons now all feel generic and there is a distinct imbalance amongst them. Is this a bad game? no it is not at all, its above average, with good gameplay and great graphics. Did I enjoy this game? No, unlike all of the other From Soft games I have played I found this one unenjoyable for almost the entire 100+ hr playthrough. The bright spots (boss battles) were completely overcome by horrible story delivery (an openworld is not conducive to DarskSouls style storytelling [i.e. finding NPCs, often in obtuse places, and talking with them]) and long, horribly boring stretches of running around on a horse/goat looking for things. I will not be playing through a second time, nor will I be investing in the expansion.",6,2024-08-11,PLAYSTATION 5

Guys !!!those are all the same game. wake up !!! why are you insist on playing the same game with different titles and blindly giving it high scores !?!?!?!? the only thing you do in all those games are crawling on the ground like a fox, memorizing the pattern of the silly bosses, within most annoying atmosphere without a solid story. This game is the most overhyped and overrated game ever released . Not only for 9th gen but for the entire history of video gaming. Wake up !!!! This game is another repetition of the previous 10 titles they released. Worst part is, the game is deisgned to make fun of you by dying and dying again. Games suppose to be fun. this is only adding up your stress gauche as you keep playing it. poor graphics, poor story telling, poor gaming mechanics, poor story, poor sound, unfair surprise forcing you to play the god damn game all over again from the last check point you barely made up to.... And you call this challenging the gamers ??? No it is not... Literally this game should belong to gen 7 or older. no need to create false idols for our selves.

I saw many people say that open world aspect is what makes this game great and that this is how openworld should be but i dont think so. BUT when you finally find a place where you should be the game f*cking slaps the legacy dungeons are awesome as are the boss fights(although some are longer then they should be and can get annoying).TLDR: You have fun in legacy dungeons then wander aimlessly to find another one being borded to death.Game with 10/10 potential ruined by open world",7,2024-07-23,PLAYSTATION 5

Every boss is so creative, and the lore is amazing. Every single enemy in the entire game is fantastic, with complicated movesets that teach you to try and try again until you're able to finish that boss. It’s rewarding every single time, no matter how many tries it takes. It always feels incredible to defeat a difficult or easy boss. This game is fantastic, and the visuals are gorgeous.

FearlessCritic,"Sadly, I can't know what I would think about the game if it wasn't hyped to god status. I can't believe anyone who rated the game above a score of 6/10 hasn't has a lobotomy recently. If your friend invites you over and let's you play the game in its entirety then it's a 6.5 at best for the first 70 hours maybe and then it just becomes tedious, frustrating and would better used as a torture device. If you bought the game and gave it more than 2/10, you have also got Stockholm syndrome gratis or got harassed by the fanboys who also gave half of their chromosomes for the game. Thegame doesn't provide and guidance which would be fine if it wasn't so incompetently designed that you 1000% fk yourself over enjoyment and immersion wise by exploring this which the game encourages to do. The bosses are not hard in a fun and challenging way but just frustrating to even look at. If any of you thinks I should edge to the fact that managed to defeat the boss (which was out of this world boring) and it started to run away at 30% to make the fight last 90% longer then you have to crawl back into a womb and grow a brain. I haven't seen a boss design this awful, and again, I could defeat all of them and even hitless when I didn't want to jump out of the window mid fight and just left my desk out of boredom. The only difficulty in this game is artificial, that being the awful camera and the degenerate programing behind however the game deals with inputs. There are more than 50 dungeons in the base game and none of them are unique besides legacy dungeons and even out of those, not many are fun. The amount of reused assets is depressing and tragic, should not be legal. Someone should tell Miyazaki that he shouldn't learn the definition of graphics from a playerbase that is more illiterate than a bag of potatoes. That is if he also thinks that the game has good graphics and not just decent art but I can't believe he doesn't use the players as toilet papers and laugh at them in the background for being so brainwashed zombies that they like literal **** on their plate if you paint it a different color.

PixelQuester,"Ayant récemment décroché le trophée de platine d'Elden Ring, j'ai eu le privilège de découvrir chaque recoin de ce chef-d'œuvre de FromSoftware. Ce n'est pas mon premier rendez-vous avec leurs jeux, ayant exploré Demon’s Souls en 2019 et Sekiro en 2020, je savais à quoi m'attendre sans pour autant comparer directement ces expériences. Mon aventure dans Elden Ring a été absolument captivante. Ce jeu, bien qu'extrêmement cryptique rarement explicite et constamment mystérieux, représente un véritable défi qui saura ravir les vétérans des jeux vidéo. Le secret de sa réussite ne réside pas dans sa difficulté, mais dans la manière dont il invite les joueurs à explorer, à expérimenter avec les outils disponibles et à persévérer. L'aspect du jeu qui m'a le plus fasciné est sans doute l'exploration. Elden Ring transforme chaque session en une chasse aux trésors épiques, où des secrets enfouis attendent d’être découverts, souvent empilés les uns dans les autres à la manière de poupées russes. Cette profondeur d'exploration est rare et précieuse dans le domaine des jeux vidéo. Toutefois, l’aventure n’est pas sans longueurs. Arrivée dans la zone enneigée, le jeu m'a semblé un peu interminable, le problème était probablement les donjons qui, bien que distincts, ont été redondants et ont étiré l'expérience au-delà du nécessaire. Mon passage préféré était sans doute à l'Académie de Raya Lucaria, un lieu qui m’a tellement captivée que je n’ai pu m’empêcher de penser que FromSoftware aurait pu créer un jeu Harry Potter extraordinaire. Leur maîtrise des atmosphères riches et des univers détaillés aurait certainement donné une dimension magique à l'école de sorcellerie. En conclusion, Elden Ring est une expérience ludique riche et satisfaisante, un jeu qui ne se contente pas de divertir mais invite aussi à l'admiration par sa conception et sa profondeur. Un incontournable pour les amateurs d’action et d'aventure qui apprécient les énigmes enveloppées dans des mystères.",10,2024-07-19,PLAYSTATION 5

The game's design philosophy emphasizes discovery and curiosity, with countless hidden features that are not immediately apparent, offering a unique experience to those who dare to explore its depths and uncover its mysteries.",10,2024-07-11,PLAYSTATION 5

SuperSaiyan91,"Was torn between 7 and 8. Insight into my gaming experience regarding this game: I have beaten Bloodborne 3-4 times (new game+ runs, no new file), including the DLC twice (first playthrough and new game+ 2), every boss and area (including hidden ones) - additionally, while I Iost count, I beat many dungeons and platinumed the game; I beat the Demon Souls Remake 4 times and Sekiro once (so far). I am in my first playthrough of Elden Ring and have been playing for 170 hr. I have been thoroughly exploring and completing every area and have not skipped a single boss. First, the good. The open-world is massive and beautifully designed (FromSoft always has excellent level design) - I can see why some have deemed it empty for its size but, I was happy with it (however, while the caves were awesome exploration and yielded numerous cool weapons or items, they severely lacked variety in design which can get monotonous). The addition of a horse was awesome (allowed for expeditious exploration and horseback combat). The dragon fights were super cool and cinematic (classic fantasy element). Lots of cool spells. Compared to most games, the combat is great (Typical FromSoft combat). For Souls veterans who have relished in previous Souls titles and are always waiting for the next Souls release, this game will probably be a 10/10 (some exceptions have been seen). There are multiple misses or imperfections in this game but, I won't go into too much detail. With how many bosses are repeated or simply somewhat boss versions of enemies seen in the world, and the lack of variety of cave design, as well as repeated enemies, despite the enormous ground covered, the game probably could have been smaller. This game added a lot of things from recent titles (talismans, weapons, spells, etc.) but, are mostly disappointingly underwhelming (whether it is range, damage, speed of animation or cooldown, or viability in combat). Poise is poorly done in this game. The overall mobility of the player compared to most enemies is annoyingly and unnecessarily unbalanced. The tracking of enemy moves compared to the lack thereof on the player side is frustrating. A lot of moves or movesets are difficult, in the sense it would be a difficult fight to be put in the ring against Mike Tyson in his prime with my arms tied behind my back. They have run out of ideas and essentially made things ""difficult"" for the sake of being difficult, where you'll die more due to luck of the draw on the RNG than lack of skill (at least once acquainted with the game's combat). This game is, relatively speaking, very overrated. Somewhat oversimplified, but, it is Bloodborne: removed from the gothic setting, the world magnified 10x over in size, and took the gods, outer gods with various sects of followers but, increased the amount of gods and used different mythological inspiration; however, Bloodborne's unique, Lovecraftian approach, and how unique the weapons were, along with the sidestep dodge, worked better - since the game also took less time, you're left wanting more, not tediously drained. Aside from the story, it is the combat/challenge - especially the combat/challenge - that really attracts you. Elden Ring made enemies more ridiculous in multiple ways while the player's mobility and base combat ability is nothing new. This game is overall, okay, wrapped up in very pretty paper: size and design of the world, the exorbitant amount of items, attire, spells, and weapons (I would be surprised if even 30% of the total things you get are worth it - mostly, you'll find little reason to switch up from whatever setup you've worked with for your first 30+ hours (maybe that varies from build to build). Sekiro was their best combat. Less dressed up (1 weapon / playstyle, but prosthetic tools and combat arts), but simply better: high skill requirement, but if you met it, you were rewarded by being able to die less (nonetheless, you had to remain on point and there was no room for error) or manage bosses ""easier"", like things seem easier for Crosbys, McDavids, Jordans, and so on. Sekiro had fast-paced combat that kept you engaged and on your feet, but if you're parrying was on point (parrying perfect), you can stand against any foe. You got punished if you slip, but only if you slip. Elden Ring is more dressed up, but a step back from Sekiro. Another critique accurately stated that it's like the enemies and/or bosses of Elden Ring are playing Sekiro, while you're still existing in OG Souls-style gameplay. This game was the perfect opportunity to raise the ability and difficulty of enemies (which they did) while innovating and improving the player's agility. For one, they still use the outdated, overly exaggerated animation for using curatives (adds zero value). Either way, allow for dodge cancelling out of certain animations (during cooldowns, or at the early stages of the startup). Could have included Sekiro's parrying to add value for builds that lack stagger ability.",7,2024-07-06,PLAYSTATION 5

LuckyBear,"Игры бабадзаки, всегда имели базу фанатов кричащих про хардкор, так было ещё с 1-ыми дсами и демон соулсами, когда будучи ещё пиздюком в школе мой друг рассказывал про хардконость этих игр и говорил, что только пройдя их ты станешь настоящим хардкорщиком, я прошёл игру полностью и прохожу длс, но меня не покидает ощущение вкуса дерьма у меня во рту, а вот с этого момента начну подробнее.Конкретно Элден Ринг имеет устаревшую до ужаса боёвку из мезозойской эры, где БАЗОВЫМИ механиками игры является апостол перекат и проповедник лёгкой тычки, где баланс всех боссов, строится на этих механиках. Более, базовых механик боевой системы в этой игре нет, а опционально добавленный прыжок зачастую не имеет смысла, пусть и добавляет некоторые возможности в бою с некоторыми боссами, но как известно - опционально, значит бесполезно и то, что большинство юзеров не будут использовать. Подобная устаревшая боёвка приводит лишь к тому, что твоё снаряжение не имеет смысла и единственное, что решает это то как ты задоджишь атаку и как нанесёшь, а сложность игры адаптивная и регулируется ещё более уёбищной механика сбора камней и прокачки уровня, для повышения урона по боссудля снижения урона по персонажу. Вся эта прокачка оружия и персонажа происходит в ебучих говно-данжах, сделанных на коленке с использование волшебной комбинации клавиш Ctrl + C, Ctrl + V в конце которых тебя будет ожидать босс (обычный моб). Пока количество базовых механик или обязательных механик, которые ты будешь развивать по мере прохождения игры не увеличится эта игра останется на уровне первого дс, Мистер Бабадзаки умеет делать хорошие игры и ярким таким примером служит Sekiro, где базовое количество механик больше, которое и добавляет разнообразия в боёвку, ведь нельзянеэффективно спамить только блокпарирование. Так вот, возвращаясь к теме хардкора, его в игре нет, для меня нет ничего сложного в тесте своей выносливости на боссах, где драки, в случае недокача происходят очень долго и где к боссу не надо подбирать ключик, а нужно просто нажимать одну кнопку вовремя. Проходя длс сейчас меня не покидает чувство того, что длс мало того, что по заполненности сильно уступает открытому миру в основной игре, так ещё и вынуждает меня исследовать мир ( Нет, не вынуждает, любой босс из длс проходится по тому же принципу, что и в обычной и можно пройти любого босса с помощью зубочистки, голым и только перекатываясь). Если ты не хочешь исследовать полупустой мир объём которого искусственно выкручен для создания красивой картинки, то боссы будут иметь абсурдно большое количество здоровьяурона по тебе, не понятно лишь то, почему если они решили частично избавиться от прошлой системы прокачки, то почему не выкрутили просто уровень персонажа в старт, где тебе бы пришлось заново качать своего перса, что было бы по мне более логичным решением, а не полумерой, какой нам её представили для того, чтобы этот не обширный мир всё-таки исследовали. Это были далеко не все мои претензии к Элден Ринг и его длс, но они просто задевают основные вещи, которые в этой игре сделаны заметно хуже. Несмотря на всё, я прошёл эту игру и оказавшись она полным калом, я бы никогда не тратил бы в ней время, у этой игры есть свои плюсы, но я хочу, чтобы главный амбассадор игр подобного жанра не стоял на месте, а развивался, поэтому призываю и остальных думать и говорить о вещах, которые позволят улучшить вами любимую игру",5,2024-07-01,PLAYSTATION 5

Despite having no experience with these types of games, I found it very accessible. I refused to get help with the bosses (my husband is a big fromsoft fan and a seasoned souls player, so he offered many times to help lol), so I worked through those fights on my own, and I found it so rewarding to learn the boss moves and finally beat a boss I had been working on for a while.

Can't even read messages without PS+, but it let me for the first couple of days... (wack) - The intelligence build is too OP.

In 2022, when it won game of the year, I was pretty disappointed and never picked up a copy of the game because I didn’t think I’d enjoy it. I had played previous FromSoftware games but I was never a huge fan of them when I was younger. Eventually I cracked and picked up a copy of Elden Ring just to give it a shot. I was immediately hooked. The world was so beautiful and the game as a whole looked amazing. The combat is so smooth. There are so many playstyles, you can really make the game your own. The story was captivating and interesting despite being slightly hard to follow and understand at times. The side content and NPC quests are so fun. There are no quest markers or directions on where to go for the most part which is the one thing that usually bothers me with FromSoft games but I actually didn’t mind it. It almost adds to the openness and freedom that the game gives you, as if you’re really on that adventure. There is tons of replayability and so many different ways to play the game. The bosses are fun and unique, their fights never get old. Honestly one of the best games I’ve played recently and probably one of the best games of all time.

shizue,"Uno de los mejores juegos de la historia sin dudarlo, lo que es el combate es excepcional y la gran variedad de builds que nos ofrece el juego para cualquier tipo de jugador y objetivo haciendo el juego más dinámico y divertido dando así una gran re jugabilidad aparte de que las armas que hay tienen un diseño y habilidades increíbles bueno y ni hablar de las armaduras que son otra locura pero tampoco nos quedamos atrás con variedad de hechizos que literalmente hay hechizos para cualquier elemento y hay una variedad increíble. El mapa de elden ring ofrece una gran exploración sin límites solo el límite lo pones tú porque cualquier cosa que veas puedes llegar y además de que no te diga donde hay que ir ni que hayan marcadores hacen el juego mucho mejor, porque realmente estás jugando y enterándote de lo que tienes que hacer no solo siguiendo puntos en el mapa como un robot sin cuestionar las posibilidades que hay para llegar a x sitio. Ahora lo malo no tan malo, los controles del juego son pésimos aunque te termines acostumbrando es muy mala la elección de botones con el mando y ni hablar de la cámara que es peor aún, por eso recomiendo que con los bosses grandes no uses fijación de cámara porque te mareas, lo otro malo es que no exista un códice donde puedas ver a todos los enemigos y bosses que hay con una pequeña descripción e historia como una especia de libro y lo otro es la historia que a pesar de que la puedes conocer en youtube la mayor parte de la historia está basada en teorías que hace el jugador, una historia sin terminar pero eso lo hace mal juego?

tomatosmoothie,"I will have to say, the game is technically a banger, and you can see how this would be one of the greatest games of all time, it just didn't mesh well with what I liked. If what I say next applies to you, then you might agree too. The game is very methodical and punishing, not only by the damage, but by specifically the gameplay. You have to manage a stamina meter, which means you can't just keep attacking and dodging. I don't really like this, because this means I can't move in the way I wanna move. This causes the game to feel a little slow for people like me. Secondly, I don't like the level up system at all. You have to grind up money to level up, and you only get a single point to change one attribute. This might appeal to some, but I prefer that every level up raises all stats in a game like this, and you get a bonus point for additional leveling. Lastly, I don't like how you need certain stats to use certain weapons. You can get stuff that you can't use until hours later, which ****. I think that if you get a weapon, that you should just be able to use it. So yeah, I could say other things, but overall, I didn't like that game that much. I will give a highish score because I did appreciate the game's quality, but it is something that is not for me.",7,2024-06-15,PLAYSTATION 5

Ashee-,"As a man who enjoys soulsborne games and the soulslike genre as a whole, to those with ratings of 0 and complain that it needs a difficulty option or that you die too much, need to sink hours into the game etc. Just. Get. Better! Really I do mean it! If your weapon does no damage, check to see if it’s even upgraded! You want to try out a weapon? Upgrade it! Or use it in another play-through! Finding a boss difficult? It’s fine if you watch videos on what it does, there’s a reason why you’re able to access it even if it’s your first time playing! Did too easily? Just level up vigor! (This game is pretty bad with its vigor checks, making you level vigor before you decide to level up your actual stats.)Want to do quest lines but don’t got any markers or quest logs? Just listen to the npc the first time! Don’t skip dialogue and actually listen! You’ll be fine if you do that! Complaining about graphics? That is just a genuine issue on your end, or you haven’t bothered changing the setting(if you’re a console player) to prioritise framerate, trust me it’s worth it. Encountering bugs? This game came out 2 years ago! Your favourite will also have bugs that you exploit as well so don’t blame this game for having it when all games do, it’s natural! In the end of this review, it’s an alright game. It’s not as crazy hard as many people out to be, actually most would say it’s the easiest game for newcomers to get into the soulsborne games! Welcome to the world of soulsborne! You died. Now just play, you‘ve already sold your soul. I did when I started and disliked bloodborne, replayed it and it’s my #1 souls game.

RaulB,"Bosses have exceeded the difficulty and complexity the Dark Souls combat is able to keep up with. What was a standard melee run with no summons is now hard difficulty and the bosses are playing Sekiro while you're still playing Dark Souls. Not only are they more complex and unfun with their long combos, delayed attacks, and few openings but they're also overstat. In Dark Souls 3 NG+7 it would take a standard late game boss 3-4 attacks to kill you without buffs, plus one more due to tears of denial. Now not only do bosses kill you in 1-2 hits, but you also have no tears of denial. Bosses also have way padded health pools and defenses. If you're playing for the bosses and their amazing soundtracks, Dark Souls 3 is your game, not this. The open world is mostly empty and makes replayability a drag; you'll spend more time on the horse traversing the land than not. The best sections are the linear and concise legacy dungeons. Who would have thought. Some extra quality of life is appreciated but they also ruined some basic systems like how there's no longer hybrid elemental scaling infusion, no basic fire weapon buff spell, lightning infusion scaling on dex rather than faith, and other grievances. There's very few realistic medieval knight armor sets like there were in prior games; most sets are fantastical and have extra stuff on the helmet that completely ruin the look.",7,2024-06-12,PLAYSTATION 5

jellyrilla,"Vastly expansive and frankly a bit overwhelming, Elden Ring does almost nothing but impress from a visual storytelling and worldbuilding standpoint. The map is wildly diverse, as are its foes and creatures, and it does an incredible job of drawing the player in from the moment they step into Limgrave from the tutorial. It's story is one wrapped in subtlety in an almost aggravating way. The game never really allows you to FULLY understand what's going on and that can be frustrating for first time players who are undoubtedly drawn in to the incredible character and world design, but that's about all there is in terms of critique for this game. Elden Ring is one of those games that simply will never get old. It looks gorgeous by today's standards, and will look gorgeous for years to come, because of the unmatched visual talent over at From Software. It's beyond impressive what they were able to convey in this game's environment, and its undoubtedly the best aspect of the entire game, as good as it is. It's a major step forward in the soulsborne genre, and will no doubt pave the way for From Software's future work. There were a few balancing issues at launch, with certain weapons being a bit cheesy and unfun, but that never took away from the incredible PvE experience. Just affected pvp interactions on occasion. Every remembrance boss tops the last in terms of quality, with incredibly crafted movesets that allow for the player to learn and adapt in a wildly engaging way. On top of the meticulous gameplay design, all of the major bosses simply look cool. and that goes a LONG way for the first-time experience. Overall Elden Ring is, in my opinion, the pinnacle of the soulsborne genre. I'm sure it will be topped, but for now, it stands alone as an amalgamation of what makes these games uniquely incredible, and it deserves its flowers.",9,2024-06-10,PLAYSTATION 5

BilkyBilkinson,"Elden Ring, the much-anticipated collaboration between FromSoftware and George R.R. Martin has taken the gaming world by storm. As a long-time fan of the Soulsborne series, I approached Elden Ring with both excitement and trepidation, wondering if it could possibly live up to the monumental expectations. What I found was a game that not only met those expectations but transcended them, delivering an experience that is as profoundly moving as it is challenging.From the moment you step into the Lands Between, it’s clear that Elden Ring is a labor of love. The world is vast and meticulously crafted, with every region telling its own story through environmental details and carefully placed lore items. George R.R. Martin’s influence is palpable in the rich tapestry of history and mythology that underpins the game. The narrative unfolds in layers, encouraging players to explore and piece together the intricate puzzle of the world’s past and present. This method of storytelling, a hallmark of FromSoftware’s games, reaches new heights here, blending mystery with revelation in a way that is deeply satisfying.Elden Ring’s gameplay is a masterful evolution of the Soulsborne formula. The combat is as tight and demanding as ever, requiring precision, strategy, and adaptability. What sets Elden Ring apart is its open-world design, which offers unprecedented freedom and encourages exploration. The addition of the Spectral Steed, Torrent, transforms traversal, allowing players to cover vast distances swiftly and engage in mounted combat. This innovation adds a dynamic layer to the already rich combat system, making encounters feel fresh and **** game’s difficulty is a topic of much discussion, but it’s worth noting that Elden Ring provides a variety of tools to aid players. The summoning system, which allows for cooperative play, is more accessible than ever, and the inclusion of Spirit Ashes provides an additional layer of strategy. These elements make the game more approachable without sacrificing the core challenge that fans cherish.Visually, Elden Ring is breathtaking. The art direction is nothing short of spectacular, with each area offering distinct and unforgettable aesthetics. From the hauntingly beautiful ruins of Limgrave to the eerie majesty of the Erdtree, the game is a feast for the eyes. The attention to detail is astounding, with every nook and cranny packed with secrets waiting to be **** audio design is equally impressive. The score, composed by Yuka Kitamura and Tsukasa Saitoh, perfectly complements the game’s atmosphere, ranging from hauntingly melancholic to triumphantly epic. Sound effects are meticulously crafted, enhancing the immersion and making every action feel weighty and significant.Elden Ring offers deep character customization, allowing players to tailor their experience to their preferred playstyle. The range of available weapons, spells, and abilities is vast, providing a level of flexibility that is unmatched. The character progression system is intuitive yet deep, rewarding experimentation and thoughtful planning. This depth extends to the game’s NPCs, whose stories and quests add layers of meaning and consequence to the player’s **** narrative of Elden Ring is a dark and captivating tale of ambition, loss, and redemption. It explores themes of power, corruption, and the cyclical nature of history with a poignancy that is rare in video games. The characters you meet are complex and multifaceted, their fates intertwined with the larger narrative in ways that are often surprising and moving. The game’s ending, or rather endings, are thought-provoking and offer a sense of closure that is both satisfying and open to interpretation.Elden Ring is a triumph, a game that pushes the boundaries of what an open-world RPG can be. It seamlessly blends FromSoftware’s signature gameplay with a richly detailed world and a narrative that resonates on a deeply emotional level. The result is a game that is not only a joy to play but also a profound experience that stays with you long after the credits **** an era where many games are content to follow established formulas, Elden Ring dares to innovate, to challenge, and to inspire. It is a testament to the power of video games as an art form and a reminder of why we fell in love with gaming in the first place. Whether you are a veteran of the Soulsborne series or a newcomer to FromSoftware’s worlds, Elden Ring is a journey that you will not want to miss.",9,2024-06-08,PLAYSTATION 5

Once you acquire a good weapon, which requires some initial effort, you tend to stick with it for the rest of the game. This is because there are only a few truly effective weapons, and upgrading a weapon is such an investment that farming materials to level up another one feels **** game features a wide variety of enemies, but unfortunately, about 70% of them share the same moveset and slow behavior, making them easy to defeat in 2-3 hits.

johnny34,"To be honest, the fact that the press unanimously ranks ‘Elden Ring’ as one of the best games of all time makes me question the extent to which traditional gaming journalism is still legitimate in the 21st century, the age of technology-driven democratisation of game reviews via YouTube, reddit, etc. I am very sure that the title will not stand up to a retrospective re-evaluation. In terms of art direction and gameplay, I see a generic dark fantasy third-person action RPG here that doesn't set its own accents. The graphics are largely unspectacular; although there are some appealing architectural set pieces, the title is still on a par with a PS3 HD adaptation. Ugly subtleties, such as the mounts jerking (or ‘clipping’) over the uneven landscape, do the overall impression no favours either. The descriptions in most reviews resemble a veritable promise of experience, a form of immersive overpowering that I - especially as someone who has no experience with the developer studio's previous work - cannot comprehend in this way. Anyone who doesn't enjoy running in circles to defeat woodenly animated enemies should give the title a miss. After 10 hours, I had run out of steam.",0,2024-06-05,PLAYSTATION 5

dowdarrow,"Since the single player DLC is releasing soon, I wanted to return to the world that FromSoft created and finally post my thoughts on this amazing game. While I am a long time Soulsborne fan, ER stands out as both new and familiar. There will be bonfires, estus flasks to upgrade, and the loss of all your souls when you die, sure, but unlike all the previous games in the series, ER offers unrivaled freedom. One of the barriers to entry in other Soulsborne games is the soul crushing difficulty that can gate keep you from progressing. But ERlargely eliminates this by making most bosses in the game optional or skippable. Moreover, you can go do something else to improve your skills.

È incredibile come il gioco, pur essendo uno dei più lunghi che io abbia mai giocato, non mi ha mai annoiato, portandomi addirittura a completare più run per scoprirne tutti i segreti, vuoi che il level design è ben strutturato e quasi sempre stimolante( le battute finali si perdono un po’ per poi riesplodere con ancor più magnificenza nel finale), vuoi che ci sono una miriade di nemici diversi ed un numero di boss assolutamente FOLLE, Elden Ring merita a pieno titolo di essere nell’Olimpo dei videogiochi e sicuramente fra 20/30 anni si vedrà a lui come una delle colonne portanti del Gaming futuro.",10,2024-06-01,PLAYSTATION 5

Otherwise, it's essentially a uninspired repetition of the same ol' that From Software has been doing for over a decade now. The setting is the same boring, vague Euro-medieval high-fantasy world but without any actually intriguing lore or world-building; the gameplay is identical to Dark Souls except they have added the jumping and stealth mechanics of Sekiro, which is cool I guess except it's still nothing innovative. The only innovative mechanic is the horse combat and platforming which is the best part of the game IMO. Otherwise, the new ""open-world"" really adds little to ****'re just using a horse to traverse big empty open spaces without any of the interesting characters, random encounters etc. **** open-world game like Horizon Zero, Witcher 3 etc. In conclusion, unless you literally can't get enough of the same old Souls formula, or you've never played a Souls game before, this game is kind of boring, monotonous and not engaging.

MurphyBrandon,"Elden Ring has an incredible number of fascinating locations to explore and cool enemies to fight. The developer studio has refined the precision of combat over their past five games, and it still feels so good to outmaneuver dangerous foes. The music and art direction are as beautiful and powerful as ever before. They really do most of the work to set the tone for an epic adventure with a dramatic finale. Elden Ring is more accessible than any Dark Souls game. Example #1: Stakes of Marika allow players to revive closer to the boss arenas and get back to the action quicker. Example #2: The mount in this game spawns out of thin air and moves through the open world faster than the normal movement speed. Example #3: Spirit ashes enable a variety of NPC summons to be upgraded, and they make boss fights a lot easier. Example #4: Invasions only happen when you voluntarily interact with the online summons. They do not happen randomly in the open world. Example #5: Fast travel is more convenient than before. All of these quality-of-life improvements make Elden Ring more enjoyable for the average player by cutting out some of the tedium.",10,2024-01-30,PLAYSTATION 5

It's a game that brought back memories of my school days, when I was immersed in the vast world of Skyrim, exploring every nook and cranny. Despite any personal preferences, there's no denying the brilliance of this game. Admittedly, there are some areas where it falls short, such as dated movements and assets recycled from previous From Software titles.

Fides189,"Would do 8.5, but meta doesn't allow for half points. I loved Bloodborne and Sekiro, so I wanted to love this, but just never reached the same highs for me personally. Not to take away from it as I see the appeal that many would love about it, but I'm not big for massive open worlds as is (for example, not a huge fan of Breath of the Wild, though I understood why people would love it). The open world gave you some freedom to explore and tackle the world as you see fit, which is awesome, but I felt there were some crazy OP abilities. Mimic Tear trivialized so many fights and while I could have just not used it, I was too stubborn to change my build (and also lacked refinement materials to upgrade other weapons and try different things), so I resorted it to it more and more at the end. Partially my own fault, but as mentioned, I don't really like aimlessly exploring so I didn't want to go find more materials. Once in awhile, I don't mind getting lost and exploring, but to do it for the entire game is not for me. Overall, its a great game, deserving of all the accolades, but just didn't personally resonate with me.

Yeah technically its better than DS3 but who cares if the world building is trash? Go ahead and just play DS3 instead, at least that one doesn't wastes your time with it's linear level desing. The only good thing about this game are the enclosed areas like the Lucidia or how is it called academy, and of course the bosses, the rest is absolute time wasting garbage.

Be11e,"COMBAT/BOSSES: Fantastic boss fights. Enemy designs are great.Build diversity is good. Combat system is certainly an upgrade from the previous souls games, with the introduction of stance stagger system, jumping/crouching attacks and customizable ashes of war. I also like how you're incentivized to be aggressive with heavy weapons despite their slow movesets, since they are the most effective at breaking stances. RPG: The leveling system is as shallow as it's always been, meaning it's just a numbers game. It can barely be called an RPG system. The only stat that (kinda) affects how you PLAY is endurance, which determines how aggressive you can be, and how much you can block with shields. Everything else is merely numbers. More HP, more damage, that's it. You increase *your* numbers for the higher numbers the *enemies* will have in the next area. Nothing but a game of cat and mouse. Leveling stats doesn't expand your gameplay, it just gives you the illusion of your character getting 'stronger'. Whether you're at level 50 or level 200, what you can do is essentially the same. They could've implemented a light skill tree system that will add more variety/flavor to your playstyle and personalize your build. OPEN WORLD/LEVEL DESIGN: Did it really have to be...? Other than the few night-only mini-bosses, there's no randomized or rare encounters at all. Everything is exactly the same whenever you open the game. Same enemies, same number of them, same spot, every single time. No random NPC inhabitants either. Everything is 100% scripted. After you're greeted with all the 'surprises' on your first playthrough, the open world parts will only get more tedious on consecutive runs. The amount of reused enemies, especially in the snowy mountain, is laughable. There's like 15 or so enemy types in that area and ONLY 1 of them is unique (well technically... since they also appear in an evergaol and a catacomb) to that area. Apparently everything in this game is built to be able to survive under any climate. Very immersion breaking. They really missed the opportunity to take advantage of the open world formula. At core, it really is just a stretched out version of any of the previous souls game. Even the Legacy Dungeons, which are good for the most part, aren't on par with some of the best levels they made in the past.",7,2024-04-23,PLAYSTATION 5
Sandrobero,"The absolute genius behind the design of this game is jawdropping. It has an amazing world filled with **** ton of content and amazing boss fights.

This was my first soulslike too and had I given up, I would have missed out on one of the greatest gaming experiences of my life!

BuenosNoches,"This could have been an incredible game but the developers took ""difficult for difficulty's sake"" to an extremely stupid level. Some of the mechanics of some of the fights are cheesy in the way they are made to be hard in a way that feels artificial and poorly thought out. Some of the fights, such as Malenia, are outright cringe in how artificial the difficulty is made to be. With mechanics that are in no way blockable/maneuverable where you are made to eat the damage so to speak, whether you end up winning the battle or not ends up coming down to RNG. Now, I am not going to waste my precious time fighting an enemy where whether or not I am able to beat them boils down to luck. This is even more stridently the case with ""second phase"" fights. Some fights have a first phase that is already difficult and time consuming enough where everything has to go right enough to be able to succeed. Then, lo and behold, comes a second phase that leaves no room for anything going wrong. When you die during the second phase of a fight, guess what? You're back right at the very start of the fight, having to have the stars align once again to get to the second phase yet again. That is not a recipe for a good game. There could have been an autosave between boss phases; what does it achieve making a player re-do a first phase of a fight they have already beaten? It really gives the impression that the developers on this game were on a power trip with how much they wanted to maximise difficulty to a gratuitous extent. Now, the only reason I am giving this game a 5 instead of a 3 is because visually the game is beautiful, it is expansive in its scope and the things it gets right in gameplay it gets really right and it can be very fun at times. One of the other negatives of the game that brought the score down is that it is totally lacking in depth of RPG elements. Now this game was my introduction to the FromSoftware franchise and having had a long history of playing RPG's I can say that this game left much to be desired in that department. The itemisation reminds me of something from an adventure game as opposed to an RPG, that's how simplistic it is. Having played games like Morrowind and Diablo II which had brilliant itemisation it really isn't hard to stand on the shoulders of giants and simply emulate what they do if it isn't too hard to source your own style from scratch. This leaves the game world feeling very bland. The side-quests in the game are convoluted and you will be consulting a guide if you want to access most of this content as it is extremely obscure where the starting points of these quests are and even their progression throughout the world. This is in line with the storyline in general, which, let's be honest, is trivial to the point of nonexistence in this game. Furthermore, the game ironically name drops George R. R. Martin as having had a hand in crafting the story, however the extent of his influence on the game appears to be extremely limited and it feels like his name was just used as a marketing tool which I feel is very cynical and unethical of the developers. This game is absolutely overrated in its current form, it really doesn't feel like a finished well curated product. It feels almost as if the developers ran out of time.",5,2024-04-22,PLAYSTATION 5

The combat is perfected, it is open world, it has varieties of content (all bosses took me 50 hours ngl) What it lacks is story, cutscenes etc.I know its a souls game but it would be good if they made our character speak for once like sekiro, and it would also be better if we werent alone most if the time(torrent doesnt count)When you play it, the music, enviroment, player,… all make you feel emptiness. The cutscenes arent even that much, its all just boss transitions. The only thing thst they have to add is more (understandable) story ( not lore ) And some humor would make it perfect. An open world rpg with a lot of npcs and side quests would also have player made choices/dialogues like sekiro The game lacks allies, cutscenes, and mostly player dialogues/choices if it had those 3 and if it was a little bit less empty then I would rate it 10/10 It is almost perfect for me but those are key factors to games : Story (not lote ofc)",6,2024-04-12,PLAYSTATION 5

Level design is fantastic, allowing you to view unreachable spots that challenge you to seek them out. The different biomes are designed beautifully, and bosses are freshly original in their attacking moves and how to defeat them. Really the only gripe I have with the game is that certain fighter classes clearly have an advantage; especially a magic-only build is a much harder, less fair challenge and only a small range of spells are truly useful, so that I was kind of forced not to play as a fully-fledged sorcerer because then the game is much less fun.

No, I don't need my hand held everywhere in a game, but I also don't want a game so convoluted and hard to follow that it basically requires following YouTube guides to complete quests. And don't even get me started on how ridiculously repetitive the open world is. Every mini dungeon or cave is a carbon copy. The whole world uses more copy/paste than FFXIV 1.0 did.

After completing Elden, do yourself a favour and complete the Fromsoft tour of games that are all built on the same principles. My suggested order is Dark Souls 1 (Remastered), Bloodborne, Demon Souls (remake), Dark Souls 3 and Sekiro. If that isn't enough Dark Souls then pick up Dark Souls 2, just be warned that this is the only title that has no remake or remaster and infamously had to dial down it's ambitions leaving some parts of the game feeling a little rough, including hit boxes.

The story was quite but very interesting keeping me invested into the game longer, and exploration felt really good despite having no pins to tell you where to go and each ending had its own very different meaning to it, I gotten almost 300 hours of game play and I have platnumed the game I recommend this game highly Get gud scrub",10,2024-03-20,PLAYSTATION 5

Leocarpo,"It won goty due no more fierce competitors and pvp community tbh. When I played it below 1.04 patch, it was a broken bloatness when the dual encounters started plus those recycled tombs and bosses. But that was just a glance after I experience the most bs design on the franchise on the godskin duo; while one was beyblading endlessly on a loop cancel animation, the other was ganking on your out of sight lock on panic roll adjustment that became worse when pillars destroyed. Even with mimic, 1st time ever I checked a post on fromsoftware games to deal with them so sleep bomb became the bandage saviour. After the fire giant it became a boss rush that I berserk rushed on 2 tries max each boss because I had enough, I wanted to end it asap and dust it into oblivion... if I werent baited by the hype and a friend instead playing Sekiro 1st that I still play everynow and then, I would have dropped midgame.",1,2024-03-17,PLAYSTATION 5

Eden1975,"I don't have the words to describe Elden ****'s not a perfect game for sure but it has so many qualities that we forget the rest. The +:- An absolutely huge open world to explore freely- The open world is full of surprise (I'm not going to spoil but we are surprised when we discover the scale of this world)- Tons of things to discover (dungeons, caves and castles)- an absolutely phenomenal lifespan.- a varied bestiary BUT…- A magnificent artistic direction- a wave to adventure and exploration, it's not a game that holds the player by the hand and that's what makes his strength, each player will follow his own path. The -:- …Bosses who repeat themselves too often unfortunately (we often face the same bosses several times, especially and especially towards the end of the game) - I didn't find the soundtrack phenomenal (it's not bad but From Softwares has accustomed us to better especially with Bloodborne)Clearly I think Elden Ring is the richest open world in exploration to date. This is FS's first open world game and they hit hard, very hard. Even if the game is not made for everyone, especially because of its difficulty and it is a game that requires time to be devoted to it, it is certainly one of the greatest games of all **** big strong point of ER is its OW, which is one of the best open world ever created.",9,2024-03-16,PLAYSTATION 5
LightningTY,"Best game ever i love it Certainly! Elden Ring has garnered praise for several reasons: Vast and Beautiful World: The game features an expansive open-world environment with diverse landscapes. From lush forests to eerie dungeons, the Lands Between offers a captivating and visually stunning experience. Monstrous Menagerie: Elden Ring introduces a terrifying array of creatures and bosses. Each encounter is unique, challenging, and rewards strategic thinking. From colossal dragons to eerie spirits, the game’s bestiary keeps players on their toes. Deep Leveling System: The game’s leveling system is intricate and encourages experimentation. Players can customize their character’s abilities, weapons, and magic using Runes. This depth adds replayability and personalization. Atmospheric and Thrilling: Elden Ring maintains the signature dark and mysterious atmosphere seen in FromSoftware games. The haunting soundtrack, cryptic lore, and intense boss fights create an immersive experience. Spirit Companions: Obtaining the Summoner’s Bell and Spirit Ashes allows players to summon helpful spirits during battles. Having spectral allies can turn the tide in challenging encounters. Rune Farming: While boss fights can be tough, players can level up by farming runes. A secret portal leads to enemies that yield valuable runes, allowing gradual character growth. Weapon Upgrades: Beyond character leveling, players can enhance their weapons using Smithing Stones. This adds another layer of progression and combat effectiveness. In summary, Elden Ring combines breathtaking visuals, challenging gameplay, and a rich world to explore. It’s a must-play for fans of action RPGs and those seeking a gripping adventure! ️",10,2024-03-15,PLAYSTATION 5

Abraham15,"The game itself has things done very well, the artistic team, the setting and the level design, it is amazing, it is one of the best I have seen. And it has something very good, which is that it is a huge game in itself, without DLCs. It is a game whose optional questline is so long and so complete that it seems better than a paid DLC for Fallout, for example, without exaggerating. Mainly in the defects I have realized that as a casual player, crafting is irrelevant. If you do speedruns or no-hit runs, crafting is essential but I don't think it gives the normal player anything at all. The controls could be polished especially with the horse. The issue of not being able to get the map in combat doesn't contribute anything, and it makes you angry. I'm not going to go into the story since it's typical of Souls not to find out about the story, but I think the way it is told could be improved, although I don't take away it any points for this. The issue of rewards is a disaster. You kill a huge dragon and they give you a lightning stone that you will never use in your **** life. Then you can ONLY do the questlines by following guides, which is okay, I like to research on Google, but no one can do them on their own and I think this should have been improved. I'm not saying that you have to include a question mark on the map for you to go there, but something, some kind of indication. Then something that is terrible is doing a quest and they give you something that is of no use to you, it would be great to know what they are going to give you in that quest when you finish it, a bow, a magic spell, or whatever, but knowing it to continue it or not continue it. But without a doubt the worst thing is the escalation of difficulty at the end. At the end of the game there are like 4 or 5 bosses that come all in a row that have a fairly high level of difficulty, and in the end people end up destroying their character and making one of these builds that are very broken just to be able to get through the end of the game , What have the developers done? patching objects and things so that there are no broken builds. This has screwed up the game a lot, because it takes away all the replayability. I tried to do it with a warrior of strength and life and I couldn't, I started from scratch with a magician, I tried it with that lightning bolt build, they patched it when I was finishing the game, and that **** lightning bolt doesn't do anything anymore . Why am I going to spend hours with another class of character like a Confessor to test the Faith spells if at the end of the game I'm not going to be able to do it and I'll have to reconfigure everything by looking for one of these very broken builds? So I think that taking all that into account, a 9/10 is very good. Verdict: recommended. I have played two years later, now in 2024 and most of my thoughts remain still the same. Dungeon assets and enemies are so repetitive, and I think this could be upgraded just by modifying the enemies or the area bossed a bit. For example Sacroderm Duo appears thousands times, they could have modified them using a mask, or a pendent, or a neckless...This way you make them a bit different and makes the game non repetitive.",10,2024-03-15,PLAYSTATION 5

SugarHBear,"When I first played ER with seemingly everyone else in spring 2022, it was my first souls-like and a great game about which I obsessed (I even named my best weapons and spirits)! I loved the fact you could make yourself Gandolf, Kratos, Shinobi, or whoever. But I thought it was flawed in how long it was, how unrewarding treasures could be if they didn't match your build, and how the early game is more fun with frequent leveling up and painstakingly crafted areas. Ultimately ER made me want to try other games that were like it but even better. Here we are 2 years later, and now I appreciate just how wonderful Elden Ring is. For all its glaring flaws, no other game approaches ER's fun customizable combat and builds. No other souls-like (mostly) respects your time by not subjecting you to boss runs -- the equivalent of lengthy unskippable cutscenes before each boss attempt. I originally gave ER a 9 on my first 100+ hours. On my new playthrough 2 years later, I'd say it's a 10 given how apparently hard it is for any other game to come close.",10,2024-03-15,PLAYSTATION 5

The challenging boss fights deliver a thrilling and demanding experience, establishing its status as one of the finest action RPGs to date.

HDSpeed19,"Elden Ring. Words can’t describe how amazing this game is. On my PS4 I got a game called Sekiro. My first fromsoftware game. I was absolutely horrendous at it, but I loved it. Could never beat it. When I got my PS5, I downloaded Demon Souls remastered, super cool, but it just didn’t hook me. Never beat it. Than Elden Ring came out. I figured it would be the same, like it, **** at it, never beat **** something was very different right away. I will never forget opening that door into Limgrave for the first time. I can’t even describe it,but I truly believe it is something all gamers should experience. And I did **** at it, I died hundreds of times.(generous very well could have been thousands) but when I say I was hooked, I was hooked. I could not stop playing, exploring.. I was fully immersed into this beautiful world. Hundreds of hours later I beat it for the first time. I nearly cried. I thought that was it, would never play again, but I didn’t stop, I did NG+ and was truly amazed by how it didn’t feel repetitive, I found NEW things, areas, quests, npcs, lore… soon enough I was on another NG+ and looking at the trophies, I only needed 1 or two more trophies to Platinum. And I did. One of the most rewarding and meaningful gaming moments of my life. Since then, I’ve beaten Sekiro, Demon SoulsPS5, Dark Souls 3, and currently playing Bloodborn with intentions of play the other dark souls games after. Elden Ring completely changes my gaming genre. Souls like have become my favorite genre of game by a MILE. But nothing has come close to Elden Ring. It truly is my favorite game, and I will die on this hill of saying it is the GREATEST game of all time. I can’t recommend a game more than this.",10,2024-03-02,PLAYSTATION 5

bigboss_mkh,"I finally broke my streak and finished my first souls game after going through 3 games starting with ""Bloodborne"", then followed by ""Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice"" and ""Elden Ring"". I stopped playing all of these games after putting a few hours into each and moved on. The main reason that kept me from continuing my journey into each of them was the fact that there's no objective marker, a deep menu explaining what I need to do or a proper story with interesting characters guiding me. The game wants you to find your way by yourself and exploring its vast world through your own pace. I've tried doing what the game wants me to do 3 times and playing it properly without any guide from the internet or any other souls player, and that, led to me uninstalling the game after every single try. That was about a year ago. One day, after watching a video about a souls player playing Elden Ring and explaining the story and the mechanics of the game while playing it, the thought of playing Elden Ring came to my head again. But this time, I was going to get help from outside sources and watch guides on how to actually beat the game. That was a tremendous help and boosted my motivation. I'm gonna start with the negatives. After putting 90 hours, I finally platinumed the game and beat it. And with all that, I think that this has to be most Over-Rated game of all time with a metascore of 96. The game doesn't explain it's story at all and wants you to find out about it though it's item description and environmental story telling, which I feel extremely overwhelming for new players especially for it's massive open-world. I know that most souls games are exactly like this and a lot of people enjoy this type of story telling, but I do not like it to be honest. Even after watching videos on the story and lore of the game, I still find it extremely disappointing. If there was a good story, with great side characters motivating you to push through the game, It would have been 10 times more enjoyable, but Elden Ring lacks in that part. Even the game lacks great boss fights which is the main reason you get exciting about beating the game in the first place. None of the fights except for the early boss fights feel fair. They all have delayed combo attacks with AoE that one shots you even with the most powerful builds and stats, and it forces you to use summons and changing your build for most of it's the prime bosses. The game gives you so many items to use but you are only gonna use a few of them at the time depending on your build and this, completely removes the enjoyment of exploring dungeons and camps since you are gonna end up with items you're not gonna use and small amount of runes. Speaking of dungeons, FromSoftware did a great job of copy pasting 4-5 designed layouts and randomizing them with random copy-pasted bosses and calling it a day. And, so many people are praising it for being unique when it comes to open-world games. There's so much to talk about when it comes to discussing the gameplay aspect of Elden Ring and I can't include all of that in my short review of this game. After reading all these, you're gonna say, So why did you gave it an 8/10 ???. Lemme tell you: The world design, The art-syle and music!!! Even the enemy designs. It's so good that you can't give the game a low score even tho it has a lot of serious problems. With all that, I'm gonna say that I'm gonna try more souls games and continue my journey with them from the experience I got from playing Elden Ring.",8,2024-02-27,PLAYSTATION 5

DarkwingSchmuck,"Elden Ring is a very interesting entry in Miyazaki's Souls series. Less unique for the genre than Sekiro, Elden Ring is basically Dark Souls 4 with a Breath of the Wild-styled open world, and while the results are exceptional, some of the appeal of the traditional Souls level design is lost in the transition. Having said that, the FromSoftware formula was in need of a shake up, and Miyazaki and his team have succeeded in implementing the open world design seamlessly into that Souls formula. This is without question one of the best open world designs you'll find in an open world game, with vast dungeons and filled with exciting content. The only drawback is that side dungeons begin to feel repetitive, and the game is so dense that it may have you feeling exhausted with it before the end -- an issue not seen in the best of FromSoftware's library.",9,2024-02-24,PLAYSTATION 5

EdwardG,"Set in the stunning, decaying Lands Between, Elden Ring is an iconic, memorable action RPG. The plot is cryptic - you have to put in quite some effort or more likely consult the internet to fully appreciate the lore, and even then... But what really sticks with you is the atmosphere and tone that the game strikes. The environment tells a story of morbid, haunting beauty that's well conveyed and utterly captivating. The combat and difficulty of enemy encounters is what the Souls games are known for, and this is no walk through the park. It's only occasionally frustratingly difficult, though, and the challenge is a rewarding one. With time, you can make your character decently overpowered, and the amount of unique weapons and spells and summons you're rewarded with is impressive. Of course, it goes without saying that the boss fights are epic and a real highlight of Elden Ring. It's a proper game. There's no **** busywork, with the huge Lands Between filled with stuff for you to explore organically. Elden Ring offers a coherent package with a first-rate style and identity.

misjakj,"Absolutely! Here's a seamless and concise summary of your review:Elden Ring shines as 2022's gaming masterpiece, captivating with its revival of deep, exploratory joy and offering over 80 magical hours of gameplay that every PS5 and XBOX X owner should experience. As my introduction to the Souls-like genre, the game presented a fresh challenge with its unique gameplay mechanics and priority settings, deeply immersing me into Miyazaki's intricately crafted world. The plot, shrouded in mystery and complexity, demanded external resources for a fuller understanding, reflecting the game's depth and aligning with genre expectations. The steep learning curve, especially in mastering controls, not only heightened the sense of achievement but also solidified my engagement with the game. Elden Ring's open world, a new feature for the series, offered an unparalleled sense of freedom and exploration, sparking curiosity and discovery at every turn, much like the exploratory joy found in Minecraft. The graphics, with options for native 4K at 30fps or 2K at 60fps, were breathtaking, allowing me to tailor my experience between visual fidelity and performance without sacrificing the game's stunning visuals. The musical score seamlessly enhanced the gameplay, with the memorable main theme evoking a deep emotional connection and driving my progression. Despite spending over 85 hours in the game, the lore remained enigmatic, revealing its true depth only through dedicated research and adding to the game's mystique and replayability. While the intricate controls and dense lore posed challenges, they contributed to the game's charm, making any perceived flaws negligible. As my first foray into this genre, Elden Ring set a high bar, leaving me with little to criticize and much to admire, embodying a true gaming masterpiece that challenges and delights in equal measure.",9,2022-04-07,PLAYSTATION 5
Shtiggy,"First, my initial review was a 1, then an 8, and now it is a 10. i.e. I hated this game at first but love it now. If you are new, keep at it and read guides on starting the game. I don't like that you need to review guides on how to level up quickly, especially at the start of the game. I feel like the first camp you come across should have sufficient rune drops to allow you to level up sufficiently without having to grind for a while. But, with the guides out there, it makes it worth your while on giving you information on great rune farm locations. When you are new, you need to get to the Greyroll's Dragonbarrow boulder farm. Thankfully, the internet is full of info on what to do and where to go.",10,2024-02-11,PLAYSTATION 5

MetaBones,"While I did participate in multiplayer with a friend and do everything effectively twice, I was shocked to find myself at about 120 hours into the game and still hadn't seen the credits. For any player that's wanting to skip all of the exploration, story, and world-building, Elden Ring can certainly cater to you. However, as someone that likes to take my time with my games, I enjoyed being a part of this world for so long. Full retail price doesn't even cover the amount of content and fun you can have in this game. While I did get frustrated with certain mechanics and features of the game (like the boss's unwillingness to stop their combos for one second to give you a chance to attack), I felt like this was FromSoft's culmination of countless lessons. As someone that just finished Dark Souls 1 not too long ago, I loved all of the quality-of-life changes they applied to this formula.

Sound design and sound track are also of superior quality and integral to the Elden Ring immersion experience. The story is mysterious by nature, spiritual, puzzle like, dream like and just as level exploration and boss fighting, part of what will motivate you to go until the end. Providing you're up for the challenge. The Elden Ring unique experience. Now after more than 100 hours into it, I might say it went on for too long and the dungeons got repetitive.

CredWhereDue,"I am old enough that my gaming days go back to when Mike Tyson's punch out was brand new. I say this because Punch Out taught us that it didn't matter what your reflexes were like, it didn't matter how you wanted to do the fight, it only mattered that you pushed the right button when you got the right cue to do so. Elden Ring and Fromsoft as I understand it, since Elden is the first time I've played a Souls game since the first one, has evolved along the wrong lines. If I wanted to engage in an escape where I simply needed to use proper timing to produce a desired result I'd learn to play the piano. There are some good aspects of the game to be sure. I love open world games, I like leveling, crafting, looting, and surviving. However, I hate games that are more akin to typing skills than an illusion of real skills. Dodging in this game doesn't rely on seeing and reacting, but by dying enough times to know what happens next. That's notaccomplishment to me, it's sheer stubbornness, and some endorphins from overcoming. I have gaming skills. I played through both Portal games in less than 8 hours per. I play games like Red Dead 2 and Fallout 4 without using game mechanics like Dead Eye and VATS. I can use a console controller to take down trolls who use terms like PC master race. Aside from that I have IRL martial arts, sword fighting, and archery skills (Olympic level athletes would likely have beaten me in my day, but not easily). I get the game has universal acclaim, but that's only among players, and if I wanted to impress someone with the same skill set it takes to play Elden Ring, I'd memorize all of Shakespeare's plays and sonnets, and then show off by having someone shout out a random sonnet number or act and scene then type that one out at very high speed.",2,2024-01-03,PLAYSTATION 5
AlinRaZoR21,"When it comes to combat and feel of the combat (responsiveness and weight of attacks), the Souls series has no rival. So yes, gameplay being the most important part, I'd definitely give it a 10 here. However, my main criticism is that the game relies on its gameplay entirely. The world, while absolutely gorgeous (talking from an artstyle perspective), is a bit too big and has many re-used assets, especially when it comes to bosses and dungeons. The story, while good, still suffers from Miyazaki's unnecessary ambiguousness, and more importantly this is transferred into the quest design. I'll just say this: good luck in completing the quests without following an internet guide. Other than this, I'm glad that FromSoftware became even more popular with this game's success.",8,2024-01-02,PLAYSTATION 5

Mohamed_Bahr,"My verdict: 7/10.  Drawbacks:   1- Old graphics. 2- Released with broken frame rates (still is.) 3- Sluggish character move speed. 4- Bosses/enemies overly unrealistic delayed attack patterns. 5- The game added an items cooking feature that the player less often utilizes. You end up picking so many items but almost never have to use them, which feels like a wasted effort in the end. 6- Online summoning feature doesn’t work in several locations. 8- Frequent pop in even when set to graphics mode, especially in open landscapes.  I have to say I was disappointed coming into this game with high expectations that I carried from Dark Souls and Sekiro, especially when it comes to visuals and fight speed.  In conclusion, and not discounting the positives and level of engagement and immersion this game offers, I strongly believe FromSoftware could have done better.",7,2022-07-14,PLAYSTATION 5
dab1859,"For the TLDR; it wasn't fun, more like painful torture. Maybe the initial user experience was better, however my experience was awful. For the actual design and look of the game, I rate it easily a 9.5 to 10. The level of detail and look was incredible and breathtaking. For the musical score, I have to be honest, I was hoping for a bit more variation. While the sound quality, and mixing was excellent, the music was too somber and depressing. You expect it when rummaging through dungeons, however, there's no uplifting moments in the game, it's all depressing. For that I give a 6. The game design is a mess. What I mean is, the user is set into an open world with no questline to follow, no guide, zip. Figure it out on your own and hope for the best. You don't know if you're supposed to head north south, whatever. The vast level of secrets and quest details would be impossible to follow without a youtube video. How they figured these things out is beyond me. Sometime you exhaust all dialog with an NPC, only now you have to search for them again in some other part of the world and hope the questline isn't broken. It would have been nice if there were actual functioning towns and places where every NPC isn't an enemy. Every city, barracks, castle, etc. is an enemy camp aside from the Roundtable and a select few other places. The biggest issue though, is the gameplay. I'm spamming the buttons to run, drink a health potion, whatever, and my character either isn't moving or responds too late while the boss jumps across a massive chasm in a fraction of a second only to slice me to ribbons multiple times before I can do anything. I was one-shot killed so many times it was ridiculous. The screen changes to second phase of the boss and within one second, no lying, insta-killed. For some inexplicable reason, healing your character requires you to come to a slow walk; you can drink a health potion while running. So, running away and trying to drink a health potion after you've had a special attack that took 90% of your health away just means they will hit you multiple times in the back as you try to regain health. I leveled to 206, re-specced multiple times, used numerous buffs (trinkets, armor, potions, flasks, weapons, etc.) and still got my ass handed to me. I play for fun and relaxation, not to get demoralized and frustrated to the point I'm cursing at my screen. I enjoy a challenge but the game just wasn't fun for me. I've been gaming since the early 80's, from Atari, PC, multiple gens of multiple platforms (all of them). I've never played a game that's pissed me off as much as this. I was so excited to play it since I'm a huge fan of RPG's and the genre. This game will break you.",4,2023-12-28,PLAYSTATION 5

esreverse,"Horrible user experience. Good games introduce you to gameplay and mechanics slowly and step-by-step in the first couple of hours. Take Zelda as an example: It never feels overwhelming, you always have the feeling that you understand how your current set of capabilites and tools work and where you have to go and what to do next, even though it's an open world and basically a sand box game. Elden Ring however: Basic introduction for 5 minutes, then you are thrown into the world, you have to run past or skip the first couple of bosses you encounter, you have to be at certain times of the day to trigger important events that unlock essential gameplay mechanics and character capabilities ... It's really a mess. Plus the way too poetic story telling that just leaves you with only a notion of what is going on. From my perspective (46 year old gaming veteran since Commodore 64 times), this is one of if not the worst onboarding in a game. To be honest, it's my first souls-like and without the open world approach it might have been working a bit better, but it's just not fun at all to watch hours and hours of YouTube videos to know what you have to do. It ****. Sound/music is good, but no controller rumble, clunky character movement, basically running/riding aroudn all day long, levelling up your character and weapons, trying encounters, failing, leveling up again, trying again ...

The game's vast and seamless open world, filled with diverse landscapes and secrets, sets a new standard for exploration and discovery. Its compelling lore and storytelling, supported by rich character backgrounds, add depth and intrigue to the narrative.

konung16,"This is the worst game made by From Software. It's a boring open world with no point other than trying to follow trends.

Denki92,"Literally, the worst game I've ever played. The graphics are 10 years old, the gameplay is the same as dark soul 3, a huge empty world where the only thing you can do is ride a horse and dodge enemies (they don't even serve for leveling). The only thing different from dark soul is the jumping and it completely breaks the game, you can easily do all the bosses by spamming the weapon skill and with the jumping attack. Bosses and dungeons repeated 7-8 times. Narrative completely absent (the lore written on the stones is not narrative), there are few secondary quests and they are also buggy, not to mention the collisions of enemies that attack you through the walls. Honestly, I was expecting something on the level of Sekiro, but here we're not even close. I managed to play through all the endings, disappointing and all the same, all in 90 hours of gameplay but it felt like I was wasting at least 50 of them to understand where to go and looking at online guides to understand how to reach certain places. If it had been 1/6 of what they put in without repetition it wouldn't have lasted even 20 hours. This game won the GOTY only because there were no other good video games and God of War had stolen it from Red Dead Redemption 2 in 2018. In summary, they took dark soul 3 and put a big map on it, advertised it everywhere and used the figure of George R.R. Martin for the ""story"". My final rating is ""MONOTONE"", from start to finish.",2,2023-12-13,PLAYSTATION 5
NeverCasual,"Putting more emphasis on exploration unfortunately made the game a significantly worse experience than neccessary. Using external sources to find the way to the next boss shouldn't be a thing nowadays and given the stats of the videos there were a lot of people experiencing similar issues. The design of bosses has changed massively compared to the older souls games. The emphasis is on weapon skills (Ashes of War) and no longer attacking with normal weapon skills (R1 + R2). Bosses are much more aggressive with less secure windows forcing players to either use weapons with range abilities, spells or weapons that can dish out increadible damage during these tiny windows. This is reflected in pretty much all tier lists you will stumble on. A or S-Tier Weapons have either of these properties. Unfortunately those weapons are so much better than everything else, that the endgame build variety is very low. Still, if you're playing one of those builds, bosses become quite enjoyable even if you're playing a dodge + hit playstyle (except for Malenia but this is a whole different story). Since they do not give you a clear path and just let you explore you'll sometimes be significantly underleveled and at other times overleveled for the bosses you encounter. I do not particularly like this design as the former becomes frustrating and the latter extremely disappointing - I think it is just lazy and leaved me with very mixed feelings about the game. The delivery of the story is - similar to all souls games - pretty bad. Some parts of the story may be quite good when one is listening to some Youtuber who put the effort into reading every item description but a story being good and a story being delivered well are 2 different issues. I have not put much effort into the story but given that of the 6 endings, 4 just differ in the last 2 sentences and the colour of the tree i highly doubt that there is actually quality storytelling behind it. Seems like a George R.R. Marting style of ending. However, since the combat is pretty awesome and the weapon arts are really fun, the game still gets a 7/10 from me. It is just nowhere near the same quality as Bloodborne, Sekiro or Dark Souls 3 despite using all of their mechanics.",7,2023-12-12,PLAYSTATION 5

Nothing is quite like the first play through with all of its amazing surprises and sense of exploration, but with the build variety offered, there are still so many ways to play and each offer such a unique experience that the replay value is beyond what I initially expected. Despite its reputation, the game is not very difficult. There is a learning curve and that is most found in the navigation of the menu. Many game mechanics regarding damage scaling and item usefulness are extremely obtuse. Also I love the lack of overly cluttered quest logs, but having any option to jot down a note about an NPC would be nice. Otherwise, the game is actually quite forgiving with experimentation. The player just can’t expect to brute force their way through it. It rewards patience, paying attention, and enthusiasm in the journey, which I luckily had ample supply of.

Dachshund33,"Elden Ring ist ein gutes Spiel, und für mich persönlich einer der besten Spiele der letzten Jahre. Ich muss hierzu sagen das ich kein Soulslike-Experte bin und es daher auch nicht mit anderen Spielen des gleichen Genres vergleichen kann. Allerdings würde ich das auch nicht wollen, da ich versuche jedes Spiel nur für sich alleine stehend zu bewerten. Der Schwierigkeitsgrad ist ok (meiner Meinung nach, als eine Person die mit Soulslikes eher unerfahren ist) und ich finde es sehr erfrischend, das dieses Spiel es einem zutraut auch ohne große Anleitung zurecht zu kommen und Dinge wieder selbst herausfinden zu können. Zu dem Schwierigkeitsgrad muss ich dennoch als Playstation-Spieler etwas erwähnen, das ich dennoch als kleinen Negativpunkt erwähnen muss und dass ist die Kamera. Während die kleineren Gegner die Kamera noch nicht überfordern, so ist das bei größeren Gegners ein echtes Problem. Die Fix-Kamera hat seinen Ankerpunkt (Oder mehrere bei großen Gegnern) nur an einen Punkt und nicht anhand einer Fläche des Körpers, daher spielt sie schnell verrückt wenn der Gegner schnelle, dichte Aktionen ausführt dessen Effekt, je größer der Gegner ist, verstärkt wird. (Und wenn dieser Fix-Kamera Punkt eine Zeitlang verdeckt wird ist der Gegner für das automatische Zielen unsichtbar, z.b wenn kleinere Gegner teilweise im Mittelpunkt verdeckt werden) Und gerade am Anfang des Spieles kann das sehr störend und frustrierend sein, da das Gefühl entsteht die Kämpfe wären nicht fair (Nicht zuletzt weil aufgescheuchte Gegner durch Wände zielen können) Dieser Zustand ist aber lernbar. Da hören die negativen Kritiken aber schon auf, denn alles was jetzt kommt ist meiner Meinung nach Geschmackssache. Die Welt von Elden Ring ist gefüllt und gerade für ein Open-World-Game nicht zu unnötig groß, und hat mit den Gnaden (Schnellreisepunkten die vorher gefunden werden müssen) auch eine gute Möglichkeit seine nächsten Reiseziele zu bestimmen und es gibt keine unnötigen Nebenquests die das Spiel nur strecken wollen. Zwar gibt es später wiederkehrende Gegnertypen, aber für mich persönlich ist das kein Punkt, der das Spiel schlechter macht. Die Spielmechanik, mit der Ausrüstung finde ich ebenfalls gut. Es gibt nicht die ""perfekte"" Ausrüstung, sondern je nachdem wie dein Spielstil ist ändert sich diese, dadurch wird nahezu jede Person fündig werden bis er eine Kombination aus Waffen, Ausrüstungen und Fertigkeiten gefunden hat die sie will. (Ich zum Beispiel habe einen Charakter, dem ich eine große Keule in beide Hände gedrückt und ihm extra keine Fertigkeiten gegeben habe um mir das Spiel etwas schwerer zu machen und es ist dennoch spielbar) Die Story ist recht kryptisch aber durch das Lesen von Informationen die auch auf Gegenstände, Rüstungen und Waffen stehen, wird diese gut erweitert. Aus den Gründen von Spoilern werde ich hier aber nichts erwähnen. Außerdem finde ich es gut, dass in Elden Ring der Entdeckergeist gefördert wird, nicht zuletzt dadurch, dass einem nicht alles kaputt erklärt wird. Der Sound ist stets stimmig und passt gut zu der morbiden Atmosphäre Die Grafik ist gut, aber erscheint an manchen Stellen etwas altbacken. Ich muss aber erwähnen dass die Welt diesen Punkt stark aufwertet. Die Grafik scheint im ersten Moment nichts Besonderes zu sein, sie ist aber in sich stimmig und darauf kommt es meiner Meinung nach an. Hier kommt aber jetzt das größte Lob. Dieses Spiel ist für mich so gut, da es mir nicht langweilig wird und einen großen Wiederspielwert besitzt. ich habe nun über 500 Stunden in diesem Spiel und ich weiß dass ich damit nicht alleine bin es viele gibt die noch weitaus mehr Spielzeit haben. Dieses Spiel ist sich nämlich eines meiner Meinung nach bewusst, denn es ist ein Game für Gamer und wahrscheinlich nicht für jeden etwas ist. Diese Aussage mag ein wenig komisch wirken aber in einer Zeit wo immer mehr aktuelle Themen, Politik und Werbung in AAA-Games auftauchen und das eigentliche Spiel im Hintergrund rückt, finde ich das außergewöhnlich erfrischend. Nur noch ein Nachwort: Dieses Spiel ist nicht für jeden etwas, und mag auch (vor allem die Kamera) nicht perfekt sein es lohnt sich aber diesem eine Chance zu geben, auch wenn gerade die ersten paar Stunden frustrierend sein könnten. Dieses Spiel habe ich anhand meiner Playstation5-Erfahrung, ohne Mods bewertet.",9,2023-11-30,PLAYSTATION 5

If you're on the fence trying this because the difficulty is intimidating but everything else about the game appeals to you, you should dive in and try this.

Albus89,"3 Errors! 1) Zelda botw has led the way in what the structure of an open world should be. If they have to give up the levels and manage the RPG in another way, they can surely do it (that or autolevel). Since you are not free to go wherever you want and there are inaccessible or very difficult areas that you cannot enter from the beginning. 2) An open world has to be something more... The Witcher 3, forbidden west, red dead redemption 2... They are alive! There are minigames, games within the game itself such as went or mechanical assault, random events happen, the missions are varied... Elden ring is just a big battlefield. 3) The game is too big to retain its mission structure like in other souls... Without a GUIDE you will not complete even half of them, even though the story is wonderful, it is a shame that you miss so much if you do not go to the internet. Something is wrong. We like to discover for ourselves, the problem comes when you don't discover it... It seems to me that Zelda botw is almost perfect in that sense. With structured and compiled missions but they don't give you things done. Heroic trials are perfect too. - I would give it even less marks for all this, but it is so deep in terms of the combat system and the possibilities of the role that it gets what it wants. The open world is the step we needed for the franchise but for me, we still need to get rid of old mechanics that do not fit in a huge world.

Is this an adventure I'm willing to take? I've been playing games all my life. When a group of friends first introduced me to Bloodborne I had only played it for roughly a week before I quit, threw in the towel, and gave up. I came back to the game a year later. After my year-long break, I finished the game in only a couple of days. My friends were confused but the reason was simple, I needed to fail to learn success. I would then proceed to put 1600 hours into the game. Finishing the DLC so many times that I learned how to fight Orphan Of Kos with no healing items. Needless to say I ""got good"" at Bloodborne, later playing the other From Soft titles. When this game was released I didn't immediately fall into it. It took time. Almost a year actually, but once I was in, I fell hard. This game is the phrase ""It's not the destination it's the journey"". You may not know where the upgrade materials are, but there's a cave, so let's see what's in it. This is the de-ubi-fication of video games. I wouldn't have it any other way.

Tyson966,"Elden Ring offers an exceptionally challenging gaming experience. While games typically benefit from a degree of difficulty, FromSoftware may have pushed the boundaries a bit too far, potentially detracting from the enjoyment. Navigating the game can be a struggle due to a lack of clear guidance, particularly for those new to RPGs. The narrative unfolds in a harsh setting where adversity seems omnipresent, leaving players feeling isolated and powerless. The storyline may come across as bleak and unenjoyable, lacking the support of friends, a nation, or allies. This can contribute to an overall sense of frustration and disconnection. In summary, Elden Ring may not be the most beginner-friendly option, featuring challenging gameplay and a narrative that might not resonate with everyone. It's essential to weigh your preferences for difficulty against the potential enjoyment of the storyline to determine if this game aligns with your gaming preferences.",2,2023-11-17,PLAYSTATION 5

It says a lot that my favorite areas of this game are the ""dungeon""-esque zones. The open world areas are pretty, but you'll spend most of your time in them sprinting past all the enemies and empty space. Weapon variety is disappointing, especially for the boss weapons. A majority of the bosses are reskins and forgettable, and all the ganks are poorly designed.

Empyrea,"I tried this game for 2 hours. I love RPGs, but sadly the difficulty of this game made me quit very fast. It's easy to kill the weaklings but the bosses just kill you pretty fast. Also, in this 2 hours I didn't even gain any level points. Graphics are ok, nothing special and the story so far is poor. Almost everyone wants to kill you. You can't even talk to them and when you kill them only a few drop something and that thing will most likely be unuseful. Overall, a very disappointing game. Just buy it if you like what some call ""chalenging games"".",3,2023-11-04,PLAYSTATION 5

hotminority,"A Masterpiece of Fantasy - Elden Ring Soars to a 9/10 Elden Ring has taken the gaming world by storm, and it's not hard to see why. FromSoftware and George R.R. Martin's collaboration has birthed a sprawling epic that seamlessly blends dark, intricate storytelling with challenging gameplay. It's an experience that demands your attention and rewards your dedication, securing its spot as a top-tier title. Here's why it deserves a solid 9 out of 10:Vast and Enthralling World: Elden Ring introduces us to the awe-inspiring world of the Lands Between, a meticulously crafted, interconnected realm filled with breathtaking landscapes and dangerous foes. It's a place that begs to be explored, and you'll lose countless hours doing just that.Rich Lore and Narrative: George R.R. Martin's influence on the story is evident in the game's deep lore and intricate world-building. The narrative is shrouded in mystery and lore, and it unravels slowly, encouraging players to piece together the story from fragments and lore scattered throughout the world.Intriguing Characters: The characters you meet along your journey are well-crafted and memorable, adding depth and emotional weight to the game's story. Their fates are often intertwined with the world's fate, making your choices matter.Challenging Gameplay: Elden Ring maintains the hallmark difficulty of FromSoftware titles. Combat is a visceral dance of attack and defense, demanding precise timing and strategy. Each victory is hard-earned, making success incredibly satisfying.Mounts and Open-World Exploration: The addition of mounts changes the game dynamic, allowing you to traverse the vast world more quickly. The open-world design encourages exploration and offers numerous secrets, dungeons, and hidden bosses to discover.Inventive Boss Battles: Elden Ring's boss battles are nothing short of spectacular. Each is a unique and unforgettable experience, featuring gigantic, awe-inspiring foes with complex patterns and weaknesses.Stunning Art and Sound: The game's visuals and sound design are nothing short of breathtaking. The hauntingly beautiful art direction is complemented by a captivating soundtrack that sets the mood perfectly.Online Multiplayer: The seamless integration of online features allows for a sense of camaraderie and competition among players. You can join others on their quests or engage in PvP combat for an extra layer of excitement.Freedom of Choice: Elden Ring offers a level of freedom and player agency that few other games can match. Whether it's your character's build, the order in which you tackle quests, or how you interact with the world's factions, your choices have a real impact on the unfolding story.Elden Ring is not without its flaws, with occasional performance issues and a high level of difficulty that might deter some players. However, for those who appreciate the challenge and a richly realized fantasy world, it's an absolute **** conclusion, Elden Ring stands as a testament to the power of collaboration and the potential for storytelling in the video game medium. It's a game that captivates, challenges, and transports you to a world unlike any other. While it may not be for everyone, those who embrace its dark, mysterious world will be rewarded with one of the most memorable gaming experiences of this generation. Elden Ring is a solid 9/10, deserving of every accolade it receives.",9,2023-10-27,PLAYSTATION 5

Prometheus_358,"Elden Ring è una vera e propria ventata d'aria fresca nel panorama souls ma videoludico in generale. Una direzione artistica magistrale con scorci da incorniciare a una parete, eccellente varietà di nemici, boss e npc con cui interagire. Ma l'aspetto che ho amato alla follia è la varietà di build che puoi creare, centinaia di armi, ceneri di guerra, armature e incantesimi che ti permettono di sperimentare all'infinito e sempre in modi diversi. Il riutilizzo di assetts criticato da molti imbecilli senza una benché minima conoscenza della difficoltà di sviluppare un gioco così ENORME in realtà è usata in maniera intelligente. L'unica pecca è la presenza di un paio di miniboss/nemici sbilanciati e senza senso e problemi di bilanciamento (tutti risolti con patch successive), ma ciò non ha inficiato in uno dei migliori videogiochi mai creati nella storia.

mfdez57,"It's an impressive game, a barbarity in the artistic section, a gigantic open world, no matter how much you play there are constantly new things, and it doesn't get repetitive at all. As an RPG it is outstanding because you can level up your weapons without fearing that you will find a slightly better weapon after doing so, especially because it is an open world, but on top of that you have to choose from dozens of types of weapons. In short, everything in this game is impressive and outstanding, really, it is practically perfect in everything, I recommend it without any doubt.

roscarul,"Me encanta Elden Ring, desde el primer trailer estuve con muchísimas ganas de disfrutar de él, creo que mejora mucho la fórmula de los souls y coge lo mejor de las entregas anteriores para crear lo que es para mí el Souls definitivo. No le pongo un 10 porque implicaría la perfección absoluta y quizás le falta dar un poquito más en el apartado técnico y sobre todo repetir menos bosses para ampliar contenido ya que al final los 130 (no se cuantos son, son ciento y su madre) bosses que hay a lo largo del juego al final son 50 repetidos, siguen siendo muchísimos, pero acaba cansando y estropea la experiencia, sobre todo cuando ya te has enfrentado a 5 variantes del mismo enemigo (perro estatua)",9,2023-10-24,PLAYSTATION 5

NathanLeak,"This game if my first official introduction to the soulslike genre and it doesn't disappoint in the slightest. First and foremost the gameplay is extremely fun and offers a real challenge and is always rewarding when you defeat pretty much everything. The world is beautiful and massive and there is always something of interest pretty much everywhere I go. The bosses are simply some of the best I've seen in a game period. And they offer a great challenge whenever you fight them. The music is great and often hypes you up when you meet a boss. There is so much moreI loved about this game and I could go on and on to praise it, but with that said there is a couple of minor issues and there is one element of the game that left more to be desired. With the minor issues is t How they integrated multiplayer, you see I was under the impression that you could play a full game of co-op with online players and you can but you have reinvite them everything you beat a boss and it got annoying after a while. And with every RPG there are bound to be glitches and bugs and they did appear and broke my immersion but it was nothing game breaking. Now my one major issue with the game is it's story/lore. With around 70hrs of gamplay I couldn't for the life of me tell you a characters name and there motivations. I held no emotional bond with anyone. After finishing the first playtrough all I can tell you about the narrative is that you are summed to be the king of this land and you go off and accomplish it. With that out of the way, the game is overall an amazing experience that everyone should try to play because it is deserving of it's title of Game of The Year(not my personal) and I think is my most played game of that year. 9.2/10.",9,2022-03-21,PLAYSTATION 5

But oh man did this hit everything I was craving. I felt the strong connection to the game somewhere after 15 hours. The first 15 were just trying to understand the game and mechanics and by the time you face the 4th main boss you start to crave more and more and after the 71 hours it took me to beat and platinum the game I just wanted more.

The combat is awesome and, if a boss is too hard, now you're not forced to stay on a 'die-and-repeat' loop for days, you can go almost anywhere and try to get more experience in other places. The different areas in the world are very well represented, and the surprises are at every corner. You wil find a huge variety of weapons, spells and abilities, this allow you to customize your character a lot, Very recommended, and it's a mandatory if you like soulslike games.

Nagazaki,"A beautifull follow up to the souls serie for sure. With dope features allowing a larger audience to access the game and taking some space from the gatekeeping experience from the former games. Despite providing the original experience for experienced player or fans of the franchise, just dont use the bells or companions and you'll experience the toughest fight ever encountered in the fromsoft serie. Story has a bit too many similiraties with the souls story tbh but they're plenty new characters and aspect to forget about it. Nice weapon and spell arsenal, the journey is really enjoyable and challenging. The story options and ending are really a plus allowing you to pick really different paths towars your end. That being said the openworld novelty brings more downs than ups to me. Yeah it's fine, sometimes even great but it lost definitly the mastery it used to have with the souls and the narrow LD and scenes. The dongeons are a mess, truly boring after the first 10 ones. And the ennemies being used all overs the place, sometimes even as boss is really something that took me off. Still a fantastic game tho",9,2023-10-15,PLAYSTATION 5

artorias95,After waiting for years for its release and getting all trophies of the game i can easily say that its one of the best open world games out there but definitely not the best FROMSOFTWARE project in my opinion.

OTPHJ,"I like difficult bosses, but the game keeps punishing you even when you you’re not in combat. You want story or lore? Too bad, gotta work for it. I feel like I can’t take a literal step forward in that world without needing to avoid something or fight it. I like the dark fantasy setting, I just don’t like being alone in it. you’re white-knuckling it from campfire to campfire. The game doesn’t actually encourage exploration imo. Yes, it’s a massive world and you can go anywhere.. but what’s the point if the landmarks have no narrative significance and you can’t do anything when you get there? Are you just supposed to window-shop all the bosses and enemies you can’t encounter yet? the setting is relentlessly brutal. That’s the biggest turn-off for me. The only joy that’s allowed is the EXACT moment after you defeat a boss. As soon as that animation is over you’re thinking about the nearest bonfire location to save. If the enemies didn’t reset every time you rested I think I could handle it. Then I could feel safe in certain areas and get to explore / appreciate the setting. the gameplay loop is pain and I’m not competitive enough to feel satisfaction after I using 3 hours of my life on a single encounter. I know there’s the git gud argument and maybe these games just aren’t for me.. but I’m not convinced. I love Respawn’s Jedi games and I’m a huge Berserk fan. I love to watch gameplay of Elden Ring and I 100% support any title that releases fully-functioning and with not MTX’s - that’s part of the reason I bought it.

Nekoromancer,"Elden Ring is a triumph of gaming artistry. It seamlessly combines the best elements of FromSoftware's challenging gameplay with George R.R. Martin's storytelling prowess. The result is a game that not only lives up to the immense hype but exceeds it in every way. Elden Ring is a majestic masterpiece that will be remembered as a defining moment in the world of gaming. It sets a new standard for what an action RPG can achieve, and it deserves universal acclaim for its sheer brilliance.",10,2023-10-10,PLAYSTATION 5
Jozee,"The sheer amount of player expression that is possible is just insane. I've never once seen the same setup in PVP, every person has a different playstyle. That alone is special Apparently that wasn't enough for From Soft, so they decided to also add in one of the most innovative open worlds to date, a total revise to their difficulty with Spirit Ash's, enough content to fill 3 games over, and so so many secrets! But even with everything this game gets so so right, I'll always hold a place in my heart for the world and boss design of the souls series, which I just don't think Elden Ring can quite match",9,2023-10-09,PLAYSTATION 5

frederik1478,"I enjoyed this game so much. I have put around 300 hours on it now on PC PS4 and **** game is so open and you can try so many different weapons and magic combinations. It is really fun to just play different playthroughs with different weapons and because the bosses are so well designed you can play all kinds of different ways with them.This is my favorite soul game with the Boss design because you can stance break them and make that them fun to fight against.I just love using this spiked fist weapon , so I can use bleed and Frost at the same time on the ****'s also because it is both strong and **** the game's biggest problem is that it's a open world where if you are going for a certain build then most of the content is useless it just kind of sad to look at all There is and just saying to yourself. I don't need any of it.This game could very easy be at 10 out of ten if the DLC gets out and become good.

The game is beautiful, immersive and extensive maps, the soundtrack is great, the diversity of weapons, spells and enemies is incredible. A LOT of bosses, a lot of them! In short, for those who like soulslikes, Elden Ring proves to be the best yet. The only criticism I will make is that, using summons/summons, the game becomes easy, it's just not easier than the Demon Souls remake. I wish it was more difficult or didn't have the option of summons, but that's just my opinion.",9,2023-10-03,PLAYSTATION 5

Kingslug86,"Bland open world with added copy paste cave systems, over, unique level dungeon designs we've seen in past titles. The first boss introduced a new entrance scene, which was then taken away for the rest of the game. The game felt like it was made for Co op, yet, fog walls that block progression only to summon a second later after the wall, and lack of horses make Co op a slog. Repeated night time bosses and major story bosses repeated in small dungeons. Graces everywhere. We ended up with a game that wants to strike a balance with many different audiences and ends up dissapointing the people that have been there since demon/dark souls imo. Its a shame these nothing open worlds will continue as proven by the popularity of this game. But I would prefer to see some innovation to the series and bring it back to its roots.",6,2023-10-02,PLAYSTATION 5
Abdul-Aziz34,"This game blends all the good elements of the various souls games into a masterpiece and also add some new mechanics, such as a jump button, a counter attack after blocking and more. The game is an open-world, wich means if you're having a hard time you can go somewhere else and return later (sometimes can make some areas very easy because of over-level; doesn't apply to the late game). The world is extremely huge, and has a lot of caves and cathacombs to explore, but a lot of bossess are reused in these places so It can feel a bit repetetive. The variaty of weapons and builds possibile is huge, you can make every weapon good with the right build. The game is very challenging as in every other soulsborne game, but the ashes system (wich are basically summons) can really help in lots of fights. The game is poorly optimized on PC and can also have some troubles on PS4 but not too overwhelming. The game defenitly deserved the game of the year.",9,2023-10-01,PLAYSTATION 5

The best graphics in the franchise, the most impressive areas, insane enemy designs and brilliant questlines had this game stuck in my head long after I powered down my Playstation5 - what a game!

There were a lot of deaths but it was rewarding when you got to the point of fearlessly jumping into battle and looking for trouble. The ability to explore and do side quests was cool. I appreciated the co-op support when you got in a jam at a particular stage. It was nice to have someone watch your 6 and help you defeat a boss.

KroxOmatic,"I loved the Dark souls Series and also Bloodborne and Sekiro but Elden Ring sadly can't compete with them. The Main Path (all shardbearers + rannis quest included) is great , but the Open World is empty and the dungeons (mines, crypts, caves) become dull very fast. The magic of overcoming new challenges is broken there because the reuse of bosses. In an open world you need to reuse assets,that's normal of course, but itdoesn't fit the genre. Even if you say it's not a soulslike but an open world with soulslike gameplaythe open world doesn't have anything else to offer except the combat (which is still top notch, becauseit's the same as in dark souls 3). Especially the quest design doesn't work very well, because you can call yourself lucky if you find the next quest stage by accident. I really enjoyed the main Path though and got all achievements, but after entering ng+ never had the urch to do something in the open world.",2,2023-09-22,PLAYSTATION 5

Jigroid,"""Elden Ring stands as an exemplary testament to the art of gaming. It masterfully encapsulates the transformative journey from humble beginnings as a lowly commoner, emerging from the mire in tattered garb to the gradual acquisition of skills and abilities that eventually culminate in the ascension to dominion over 'The Land Between.' The game achieves unparalleled immersion, facilitated by its superlative graphics and voice acting. Its expansive world exudes an eerie and haunting ambiance, creating a sense of seemingly boundless exploration. With an abundance of side quests, farming opportunities, rich lore, multifaceted characters, and intense combat, players can easily invest over a hundred hours before reaching the culmination of the main storyline. The gameplay experience is exceptional, offering a diverse array of melee combat styles that evolve in tandem with one's proficiency, resulting in sheer enjoyment.FromSoftware's ability to seamlessly fuse gratifying combat mechanics with theatrical musical scores and striking visuals is nothing short of astounding. Elden Ring is highly recommended for those yearning to be enveloped in a vast and foreboding realm ripe for salvation.""",9,2023-09-19,PLAYSTATION 5

SpideyTheMighty,"Elden Ring is an excellent game (GOTY 2022) and possibly the best soulslike ever created. What i really liked after 150 hours of playing and the platinum trophy is that this game wants and succeds on treating you like a clever person and not a dumb braindead gamer who only needs 2 buttons to play a game or watch 30 hours of cinematics or depend on QTEs in combat all the time. The game demands intelligence and imagination from you, from exploration to customization and from skill and technique to fast reflexes. I mean, Dark Souls 3 and Bloodborne already had these things but now they are even better. The ONLY 2 reasons that hold it back from true greatness imo (9/10 and not 10/10) are, first, the story is almost non-existent and second, the technical side in general, both in terms of graphics and music/sounds/ost, could be better. I mean, i played Hogwarts Legacy and then came back immediately to play again Elden Ring and it seemed to me like a game from 2015 or something.

sajalhsn13,"Alright, folks, let me tell you about my mind-blowing adventure with Elden Ring. This game is off-the-charts awesome, I'm giving it a solid 10/10! Seriously, it's a masterpiece that left me speechless. The world design is insane, and the combat mechanics? Oh boy, they're on a whole other level! First off, this open world is mind-blowing. It's like stepping into a fantasy dreamland. Every nook and cranny is bursting with jaw-dropping details and hidden goodies. I couldn't get enough of exploring this place. It's like a magnet, pulling you in and refusing to let **** combat is tough as nails, no doubt about it. But man, when you finally take down those enemies and bosses, the rush is unreal! You gotta be strategic, think on your feet, and time your attacks just right. But when you emerge victorious, you feel like a total **** enemy and boss designs are straight-up mind-blowing. I mean, who comes up with this stuff? FromSoftware, that's who! Each encounter is like stepping into a twisted nightmare. These baddies are creative, terrifying, and push you to the edge. But when you conquer them, oh man, it's the sweetest feeling in the world.I poured a whopping 100+ hours into this game, and guess what? Not once did I get bored. It's addicting as hell! Even after **** that platinum trophy, I dived straight into NG+3 without hesitation. I just couldn't get enough. Bottom line, if you're a fan of challenging games, Elden Ring is an absolute must-play. It's a rollercoaster ride of emotions, and the satisfaction it delivers is unmatched.

Sometimes, the chaotic scenes and issues with the lock-on mechanism can lead to frustrating, avoidable deaths.

Borrowing mechanics from the Souls series, Bloodborne and Sekiro while introducing new ones that allow for a more accessible experience (summons for example) means that it is the perfect entry point for newcomers. The open world was my biggest worry as I feared that FromSoft would lose some of their signature detail and world building, again I was proven wrong as the world of Elden Ring is not just vast but also deep, literally and figuratively. Yes it is difficult but that comes with the territory. I eagerly await the likely dlc.",10,2023-09-13,PLAYSTATION 5
GrandePeto,"I played this game in early 2023, and it was my first FromSoftware game. I really enjoyed the main story, although I had to watch a lot of videos to fully grasp it. Nevertheless, I appreciated the storytelling approach. The main bosses were all enjoyable to fight and had unique characteristics. The combat, while involving a lot of dodging and waiting for ripostes, still managed to maintain a distinct feel, although it could become somewhat repetitive at **** game's world is visually stunning, and despite the graphics not being top-notch, I found the art style to be quite appealing. My primary criticism pertains to the repeated use of bosses in the dungeons. I understand the need to populate the world, preventing it from feeling empty, and I'm pretty sure no one has discovered all the dungeons on their first playthrough. However, I encountered a significant number of identical bosses, even within the main campaign.Overall, it's a good game, especially if you're a fan of FromSoftware's previous works, and it also serves as a solid introduction if you're new to their games, as was the case in my experience.",8,2023-09-13,PLAYSTATION 5

Nmaa18,"Introduction: I adored demon's souls, therefore I decided that I had to give this game a try. There is a lot of hype surrounding this game, and people often like to compare it to its predecessors too, which makes reviewing the Elden ring harder. Nevertheless, after having played this game for 152 hours and finished it, here are my thoughts: What I liked: the sheer amount of things is insane. I don't know how miyazaki directed/planned all the story and content there is in this game. The map, the weapons, items, spells/incantations, ashes of war, and spirits for example. The map is beautiful and practical thanks to the icons you can place. One may be unhappy at the fact that areas aren't marked as cleared, but this makes Elden Ring's map more unique and less like a shopping list. Additionally, it was nice to interact with the map and mark areas unexplored. I have never used a map so much. This may sound bad but it adds more flavour to the gameplay, adds realism, and allows for a less monotonous experience. It goes without saying that the combat, levelling up system, and music are great, as usual with Fromsoftware's games. What could have been improved: A lot. While the quantity is certainly there, the quality dipped in some areas it seems. The graphics and music were slightly worse than demon's souls'. I noticed the recycling of assets (which is understandable due to the logistics of the game), and while it did not majorly bother me or hinder the gameplay, if I am to be honest with myself, its clear a lot of pasting/duplicating was done during the development process. Continually Seeing the exact same shacks, caravans, and ruins in different places was a little bit awkward. I have two more remarks. Due to the nature of the game (being open world) I went into some areas under-levelled, and into some areas/boss-fights over-levelled, which I have mixed feelings about. On one hand, nothing is ever truly easy in this game. On the other, defeating a boss in 2-3 hits can feel a little bit underwhelming. Finally, some areas (ailing village for example, or, arguably, the whole of southern limgrave) and catacombs felt pretty empty and underwhelmingly easy/short. What I didn't like: I only have one, true single issue with Elden ring. It concerns the story. There is a short cutscene at the start, then the lore and story is told through weapon descriptions and npcs. I like that i couldn't really tell what was main story and side content missions and fights and interactions. I also must be honest that there is joy to be found in digging deep online about the lore and story ****, but when it is this time-consuming, i almost feel like the game obligated to be clearer... I completed Ranni's quest and while it was a rewarding process in terms of concrete rewards, I understood nothing. It was a long side story/mission about a 4-armed, blue witch who hired 3 people to free her from... something? You put a ring on her and a sword and doll are left behind? what?? I can tell that the main objective of Elden ring was to make this game as accessible as possible, and they did so in most areas, but perplexedly, the story did not get the same treatment. I would have liked more frank and less fragmented pieces of lore, and a clearer picture about what my objective is and what it is i'm really doing in this world. After putting in 150 hours+ into the game, I can personally say that the story was largely uninteresting/unrewarding (I appreciated it much more later, on Youtube, after a few more hours of lore videos). What I'm unsure about: the story, and the spirit ashes. it depends on perspective. In conclusion: how has a relatively small (compared to the likes of ubisoft, EA, CD project red, rockstar, and so forth) video game development team such as fromsoftware been able to accomplish such a feat? It's quite incredible, and it's one of those ""i wish i could forget about this game and play it anew"" games. Miyazaki and his team doesn't miss. Another addictive classic. A tiny bit more of consistency, clarity, and quality would have put this game into the 90s. 89/100.",8,2023-09-12,PLAYSTATION 5
Alias--,"It's good, but lacking in replayability compared to previous solus games. Part of that is because of the switch to open world or ""open field"". Going open world meant sacrificing something special about the formula, the core experience of traversing those tight linear, labyrinthian corridors that defined demon souls, dark souls 1 and dark souls 3. That tight, expertly paced gameplay and sense of progression is just completely missing from this game. Instead of this the meat of the game is the huge but empty feeling open field areas. The sheer spectacle and novelty of horseback exploration of these gorgeous landscapes is enough to get you through it the first time, but this portion of the game really drags on repeat playthroughs. When the game does give you a taste of the old school souls level design like in Volcano Manor it just doesn't feel significant enough. Don't get me wrong, the amount of content is well worth the money, and you will enjoy your first time running through, but the experience just doesn't live up to the heights of the genre. My hope is that they change things up for the dlc and focus more on fleshing out the ""legacy dungeons"" rather than pushing for more time spent in huge open areas. Also a patch to change the multiplayer system would be nice, they really botched it this time around",7,2023-09-11,PLAYSTATION 5
letmesoloher,"Pros: - Good Atmosphere, the world is quite well built and has some nice visuals. It's really cool to walk around Liurna, and cross with some random caves around. Also, congratulations to whoever came with the idea of Farum Azulla, that whole place is really awesome. - No markers, making the discovery experience challenging and rewarding. The map thing is also cool. - Well designed enemies - for instance, It's very cool to fight a dragon, and every dragon has it's own power. Just to give an example of how well designed the enemies are, in Skyrim, after you fight a dragon for the second or third time, it just gets repetitive, while in Elden Ring it always feels like a completely new and unpredictable foe. - Good combat system. From souls like games - and maybe from all the games I ever played - I still prefer Bloodborne combat system, but Elden Ring fights, for me, are still much more exciting than the combat from most open world RPG's. Cons: - Repetitive Bosses. The same bosses are showed over and over again, just changing the name and increasing some of their stats, to make them feel more difficult. - Almost no soundtrack on the entire game. One of the main reasons why Skyrim was such a hit in my opinion: It had a great soundtrack, which made It's atmosphere much more immersive than most of It's genre. - Unconvincing Lore - why call George R R Martin and ask him to write the whole lore if none of this is even accesible to the public? For me It feels like NPC's are just a detail, with shallow dialogues, and honestly, the tarnished trajectory doesn't convince me at all - maybe if we were presented to whatever was written by George R R Martin, maybe it would convince us, I don't know. After you beat Malenia and the Elden Beast, It simply doesn't make much sense to keep playing this game. In Skyrim you could join the stormcloaks or the imperials, you could also do the dark brotherhood questline, or thieves guild, or even become a vampire - or maybe fight the vampires and join the dawnguard - you could also become a werewolf and join the companions if you wished, or maybe fight miraak.. I mean, the point is, the main quest was just a detail in face of all the other choices and possibilities you could take as a player - And that's why people still play Skyrim to this day. In Elden Ring, after you finish the main quest and kill the main bosses, everything just gets dull and repetitive. I get it, it's a soulslike, but in the end, It simply fails to be a compelling open world game. I liked the game, but would I play it again? Nope, because there's nothing new to see, and the whole story is not even there.",6,2023-09-10,PLAYSTATION 5

Truquibati06,"This game has been for me one of the best gaming experiences I have ever had. The world is huge and full of content and secrets. The main levels are excellently designed and the boss fights are spectacular and epic. There are literally secondary areas that are amazing and even better than some of the main ones. There is a huge variety of weapons, armour and spells, talismans and skills, which leads to a fantastic build system. The normal enemies are also great but the further you progress through the game the more they repeat themselves (also some bosses). The side quests of the npcs are very interesting and the lore of the game in general is great. If you start investigating you realise how complex it can be and how well thought out is the story that surrounds the world. It's a world that feels alive and not at all empty. One of the aspects I liked the most about Elden Ring is the artwork. It may not have the best graphics but, artistically, it's a beauty. Probably the most beautiful videogame I've ever played in my life. I'm fascinated by the amount of detail in any wall, column or structure. Also, I think it's great that the scenery itself gives you clues about the history of the place where you are. Finally, I wanted to highlight the game's amazing ability to surprise you with each new area you reach, through its fascinating art design. It's been over a year since the game's release but if you're playing it for the first time, I highly recommend you not to spoil yourself.

xYourDeus,"This game is phenomenal. One of my personal favorite games of all time. I love challenging games personally and Elden Ring was a thrill from start to finish. There's a lot to love about this game, the world is beautiful, the the boss fights are uniquely designed, the wide array or weapons and sorceries to use are extremely fun, it's extremely challenging if you like challenging games like I do. Elden Ring overall has very few low points to it. The main low points can be how the input reading in a lot of bosses is EXTREMELY prominent, some late game bosses are so heavy on the input-reading to where they will literally walk in circles with you waiting for you to move in order to counter-attack you. I've had boss fights where I've literally walked around in a circle for a few minutes without the boss even moving. The other downside is how huge of a difficulty spike the game has in the mid point, early game feels like a breeze if you've been optimizing character stats, but at mid point the enemies and bosses get so powerful they can almost one shot you all the time, to the point where it makes it seem like leveling health isn't even helpful, it's just insurance to not get one shot by some bosses. Even then, some bosses can bring you to near one shot with their combos making vigor leveling seem kind of pointless. That aside, the game has a lot of strengths in every aspect of it.",10,2023-09-06,PLAYSTATION 5

JellyMan_33,"One of the GOATs, here's why. *This game may not be for you, but it's perfect at what it sets out to be. It is the perfect high dark fantasy, action rpg. Visuals- Graphically not the greatest ever made, but the design and locales are insanely well made and detailed. Absolutely some of the most gorgeous locations and game design I've seen. Whether it's your first dip into the depths, or when you beat the first major boss and see the landscape out in front of you that's about to be your playground/deathbed, or seeing the magical academy for the first time. It's some of the most memorable moments in modern gaming. Not an overexaggerating. Music- Score and effects are fabulous and keeps you engrossed in 100+ hours in. Gameplay- You get the rock solid souls gameplay, thats been now tweeked and matured to a fine edge. Now with more choices than ever before for how to build your character and how you want to fight. Magic is fabulous, the swordplay is rock solid. The game keeps the souls difficulty but gives you a bigger toolbox against its world. I'd say it's not as hard as previous souls games, still harder than your average rpg/action game. It feels right, when you die you made a mistake, it's not bad luck or bs. -Plot/Story- typical souls fashion, this is kinda on the wayside and it takes the approach of explore and save this amazing world. This might turn some people off, but its about the game and the experience you have in the world. There are side quests and characters to meet but everything is light and vague on what is happening. **What makes this game special or different? - It's sense of wonder, danger, and exploration is second to none. Some people talk about Breath of the wild in these ways but truly it doesn't hold this game's trousers. There are multiple moments of sheer wonder and magical excitement that happened in this game that cannot be replicated, it made me feel like a kid learning to love video games all over again. Walking up to the academy still gives me chills. Absolutely a masterpiece 10/10",10,2023-08-18,PLAYSTATION 5

Shockscape,"At first I found this game too hard and nearly quit on the first boss. And you may feel this way too. But after looking at some YouTube starter guides, Elden Ring has become the best game I have ever played. So good I’ve played it 3 and a half times (3 for the platinum PS trophy, the half for fun). Some of the bosses were definitely too hard for me, but you can call upon some helpful players to assist you, or in some cases do it for you. I summoned one online helper who used a sorcery that burst a magical beam at the boss for like 8 seconds and it died instantly. But, if you managed to overcome a boss yourself, there is a great sense of achievement. The open world has an interesting design and (mostly) makes you want to explore. Unless you wanna make a B-line to the end. There’s also so many different ways you can play the game - whack stuff with a big sword, use magic and more. And there’s so many unique weapons to make ‘builds’ out of. There’s only two problems: bosses being reused, and caves/catacombs/dungeons. The second main boss is literally put into an eveergaol (a mini-boss arena, there’s multiple) but they changed like 1 or 2 letters in his name. Why? I get that they may have ran out of time to make a new boss but I’d rather get a random boss than a reused one. Also the caves and dungeons are really repetitive and the boss at the end is usually really easy and forgettable. Mainly because it’s easy to go through a dungeon that was designed for a low level than you currently are, which can definitely happen. Other than that, perfect game. I don’t want to lower the score to a 9 because it does everything else perfectly. In short, play the game. The positive reviews are all correct.",10,2023-08-17,PLAYSTATION 5

Jangotat,"I have been a fan of FromSoftwares Soulsbourne games for a comparatively short time, around 5-6 years. This being said Elden Ring blew it out of the park for me. There was a great deal of hype surrounding its release, I don't know why but it just didn't seem interesting to me. When I gave it a shot I was addicted. I sat in my tiny dorm room transported to a wonderfully dark and interesting world that I was entirely not ready for. As I sing praises for this game there is something criminal that plagues it. A certain area you are transported to near the end of the game contains three bosses ""which I know of"". One of them (technically two) is the worst boss in the game, relying on unfair mechanics to punish solo players and people who do not use tear summons. The other two are incredibly hard, but also incredibly fun. However, I have noticed as I reached around NG+7 that the first and last boss have become devoid of meaning, only existing to haunt my desire to get back onto the game. The second boss within the area is a hidden gem though, quite literally. This area and the boss that redates it are the only reasons this game isn't a 10/10 though. I highly recommend you play this game.",9,2023-08-14,PLAYSTATION 5

My girlfriend wanted to play with me and I bought it for her to enjoy together. But the invasion system is crap to say the least. It's unbalanced. She is invaded by characters much stronger than her and they kill her with one or two hits and the invaders keep running away and if you try to ignore them they chase you with ranged attacks or magic (we don't have time to waste on them). We just wanted to have fun together and she was disgusted with the game, just because of those invasions.

OwlScowling,"Before starting this review, I must acknowledge that a 10/10 does not mean it was a perfect game. Elden Ring absolutely has its issues. But if I were to average out all of the 7/10 moments along with the 12/10 moments, I really believe it would average out to a 10/10. This game far exceeded my expectations in every way imaginable. It was my second FromSoft game, following Dark Souls Remastered. The art style is absolutely breathtaking, with nearly every screen looking like it was ripped out of an oil painting. What's most remarkable is how many moments of guaranteed genuine surprise that they baked into an open world game: the first time you take the Siofra River Well elevator and see the underground night sky, jumping over the wall that leads into Caelid and seeing its blood-red sky--along with many, many others. The world is equally breathtakingly beautiful and terrifying, with creatures that will make you truly panic (the Royal Revenant comes to mind). The quality of the bosses here, are top-notch as well. Having now played all of the Soulsborne games, I can say Elden Ring has some of the best bosses, perhaps second only to Sekiro. I've heard much criticism about the bosses difficulty level, that it is so overtuned so that spirit summons are needed or some such. I completely disagree. I went through my first playthrough with plenty of summons or ashes of war. But later I went back and went through the entire game with one of the slowest weapons just for fun--the Great Club. I can tell you that even Malenia has guaranteed openings to hit a fully charged R2 with this super slow weapon. The bosses are just harder and more complex than before, with branch points in their combos based on your positioning--and I am here for it. It absolutely feels unfair at first, but once you've decided you're going to take them on solo, melee-only, it is an absolute thrill-ride. And, if you'd prefer to Comet Azur them while your Mimic takes agro--go for it! Elden Ring absolutely has its flaws (rewards for finishing dungeons not always being exciting, re-used bosses, etc), but this has to be the best game I've played in years.",10,2023-08-11,PLAYSTATION 5

Nowieso,"This has been the best first-playthrough of any game I ever had. The open world is beautiful and super fun to explore, easily the best open world we've seen so far. It's a challenging game, but never too difficult to master, and never frustrating because of the high amount of checkpoints. There are also plenty of tools in the game to make the combat much easier, such as summoning other players or NPCs for help or doing a mage build. The Story might be too difficult and complex to understand for the casual gamer, but it is very deep and interesting. The Soundtrack is beautiful and fits the game perfectly. The Art Direction has never been better. You can look in any direction in the game and it looks like a painting. There are hundreds of weapons, pieces of armor, shields, spells and more, giving the player an insane amount of options for their builds and adding a lot of replay value to the game. Bosses have very well telegraphed attacks, making it very fair to fight and learn them. Gameplay: 10/10 Combat: 10/10 Music: 10/10 Leveldesign: 10/10 Performance: 8/10 Bossdesign: 9/10 Art Direction: 10/10",10,2023-08-07,PLAYSTATION 5

Dee-Jay_Deli,"Redicilously overhyped game by a studio that has been releasing the same game with the same (outdated) engine for the past decade. All they have going for themselves is a ravid fan-base that cum everytime FromSoftware repackages the same game and critics who are excited that the game doesn't have quest icons (or any sort of guidance). But how about the 101 of good game-play, such as: Technically modern game? Responsive and fun combat? Widescreen support? Modern UI that doesn't require a tutorial to navigate? Elden Ring has none of that. Why? Because From is technically complacent...dare I say...lazy? As much as I'd love to join the circle jerk about their open world design, I just can't enjoy it because of the reasons noted above.",5,2023-08-06,PLAYSTATION 5

OnSurfari,"No, just no. If this is the direction developers are taking it's a sad future. If you were to say this is a 10, subtract 1 from the horrendous controls. You are constantly fighting the camera, even with all the ""assist"" options disabled. This engine is showing its age. Constant micro stutters where the camera is moving just a little bit in the opposite direction you are attempting to look. Subtract another 2 points for the control scheme, OMG. It's terrible. You want to switch to your bow, then back to your sword. Plan on performing a button combo as if you're playing street fighter. I would describe it as the developers just kept adding things to press and got lazy with the ergonomics. Just trying to swap out a weapon or cast a spell breaks immersion because you have to do mental gymnastics with the buttons, on top of reacting to boss fight mechanics. Just terrible. Subtract another 2 points for story direction. The developers get George R. R. Martin to assist. Now this one pissed me off, the marketing sold this as a story, ""we got the mastermind behind game of thrones to write the story"". But then they don't tell you anything, you have wander around aimlessly to discover the ""story"". Imagine paying for what you're told is a movie only to discover there was no director. Just a bunch of actors wandering around aimlessly. You'd walk out of the theater and demand a refund. I'm done with this review, there's so much more that was annoying and immersion breaking. The game is hard, as expected, but the thing that draws you into a story and immerses you into the gameplay is not there. It's a slap in the face to read and watch people praise this as the ""bar"" for game development. You want a fun game to play, immersive and with an amazing **** Dead Redemption 2, that's the bar.

YakusokuNoJi,"A really, really good game but people need to stop acting like Souls games and the new Zelda games are the second coming of Christ because they are not. They are very good but still generic games that do nothing that other games have not done before and also not in a more outstanding. Even the whole difficulty and no handholding thing is an idiotic thing people say because anyone who has some honesty admits they looked up videos or guides and that renders the point of ""oh, how cool, no handholding and what a challenge"" void.

The would feels lazily made with many rehash enemies and bosses from previous areas in this game and other From Soft games.

SpinyKoopa,It's a solid game. But nothing more than a mod. It feels like Dark Souls 3 in slow motion with meaningless encounters. The level design is significantly worse compared to the Souls Games. It feels like someone used an editor and just put mobs into a world and built some sandbox-like dungeons and ruins. It is really terrible that you actually can go everywhere but you get just killed in some locations meaning you are wandering around looking for playable content. The Story is even qorse than in the Souls games. And the media is giving 96 points.. total joke for this empty game.,6,2023-07-28,PLAYSTATION 5

Los gráficos son impresionantes, con una atención increíble al detalle que realmente te sumerge en la experiencia de juego. La jugabilidad es fluida y emocionante, proporcionando un equilibrio perfecto entre desafío y diversión. Los controles son intuitivos y fáciles de dominar, lo que hace que sea accesible tanto para jugadores novatos como para aquellos más experimentados. La historia del juego es cautivadora y llena de giros inesperados. Los personajes están bien desarrollados, cada uno con su propia personalidad y motivaciones, lo que los convierte en seres con los que puedes conectar y preocuparte por su destino. Además, la banda sonora es simplemente asombrosa. Cada pieza musical encaja perfectamente con la atmósfera del juego y te sumerge aún más en la aventura. Pero lo que realmente me impresionó fue la cantidad de contenido que ofrece el juego. Hay tantas misiones secundarias, secretos y actividades adicionales que nunca te aburrirás. Es un mundo enorme y lleno de posibilidades. En resumen, este juego es una obra maestra.

SirCarington,"I’m a casual gamer. I’m not good at gaming. I play most games on easy or the setting just above easy. I despise beating my head against a wall trying the same thing over and over when something is difficult. I used to despise soulslike games based on my limited playtime with Dark Souls and YouTube clips I’ve watched. I’d scoff (on the inside) at anyone who said their favourite game was a soulslike. I considered them purely in the domain of try-hard Chads. Since I picked up Elden Ring, my stance on soulslike has taken a 180. I am throughly enjoying it. I’m finding that if I end up in a situation I can’t handle, I can go do something else for a while until I get geared/levelled enough to take on the situation. There is still some head banging, but it gets completely overshadowed by the sense of accomplishment I get from felling a difficult boss. The story is interesting and captivating. The world is beautiful and worthy of being explored. I find I’m often excited and/or surprised. The fighting mechanics are easy to learn. Fights that seems impossible at first can be observed until the patterns become clear enough you can eventually dance your way through them. Tiny mistakes are brutally punished sometimes, but I find that makes the successes feel all the more successful. Even farming trash mobs feels like I’m getting in genuine practice, and there are enough drops not to make it feel like a waste of time. Before my time with Elden RIng I would have thought it completely ridiculous to recommend a soulslike to beginners or casuals. Now, I’d wholeheartedly recommend Elden Ring to everyone.",9,2023-07-27,PLAYSTATION 5

There is no explanation from the developers how to play the game. no explanation of what is going on.

Unfortunately I bought this game on Playstation and Sony operates the rudest customer policy out there. Sony doesn't refund customers even if you've only played for an hour. A return via Steam on PC is possible as soon as you have played it for less than 2 hours. Thank you Sony Playstation & Elder Ring for giving me such a terrible piece of sh** experience.

You dive deep into a mystical game world that is very addictive. The story is wrapped up in a soul typical way, you have to search for it, which is good, it's more realistic than 20h video sequences. The game is challenging, if you understand it this challenge is very fun and rewarding. The music is perfectly tuned and immersive. This game is a masterpiece. 160h so far, thanks for the experience.

Beautifulyinsan,"Nothing short of bombastically epic, thrilling, and amazingly incredible. explore the lands between, find hundreds of things, well designed boss fights, while with varied levels of challenge, that only makes every breath of this game predictable. one moment your exploring the vast lunaria lakes, then you might feel like trying to fight you way the terrifying scarlet rot infested caalid. variety is the name of this game, the many different builds you can make and invest into if you so desire. yeah you can't use your fists, but really all you need is just one weapon, and then the world is your to devour. plus the idea of a fromsoftware game being ""accessible"" isn't a critique, it is an upgrade, it doesn't matter if you summons, or poison darts, all it means is more toys to play with to eventually beat the game. this is not the hardest game in the souls series, everyone should know that, but that's ok, this game should be everyone's first soulsborn game, it doesn't put you in the same kind of box as the other games, with the many different conveniences to the player, like torrent for travel and speed, croach to sneak and a jump for many more possibilities of level design, platforming and exploration, which they do not disappoint on actually taking advantage of. while this game is the easiest in the franchise, it's only possible because of the tools, the boss fights are a MUCH different story, as Radaghn, Morgott(despite on getting way to easy over time) and the fire giant has sent shivers to some players spines thinking about them. and of course Mogh, maleketh, and the death of me Malenia(Blade of Michela) are ruthless, and are very unforgiving even being quotable as some of the hardest in the franchise with especially malenia competing with the likes of the nameless king and the orphan of kos as the hardest of the hardest. well at least it will be a little easier than trying to break down in tears of how great the game looks. HOW THE F*** DOES THIS GAME HAVE AS MUCH BEAUTY AS IT DOES, THIS IS THE OPITAMY OF BEAUTY IN CARNITE!!!! and that's all I have to say about the graphics. game play is tight, and as strategic as ever, with the same micro management of certain items during combat, reckless game play is still really frowned upon so its still soulsborn be weary of that, as you still need the kind of patience you need with these games, take your time to learn how the game works as per usual, but it takes that.... and lets you become GOD if you want to, just look it up i guess, no big deal. the story, while as vague as before, you will still find pieces of the puzzle scattered if you look around, and it is an incredible story. I am an incredibly snobby story writer, so I can stress how much this story treats it's self like a genius curtain unavailing at any given turn, the care and intricacies of each piece put together as a story only makes line's like malaketh's heartbreaking line""you come to covert destined death. to kill what?"" and as one of the last bosses of the game, one of the last bosses in the way to become elden lord, you do question what was the point of make the fire giants race extinct, just so you can burn the elden tree so you can become elden lord, is it necessary, yes, will you being elden lord change the fates the people in the lands between, yes, but what if the good is only temporary, what if it doesn't change it for the good. it all piles on with sentimentality, the question with the lack of answers. why? thy flame burns bright will thy flame become embers that grace the future of many experiences to come or will it engulf the fertile and wisen our next generation of artists. giveth the wisdom to the many weak minds we have been disgraced with giveth grave to the ones who need it most touch grace and believe in it.

Shugor,"Overrated… I played previous Dark souls titles and played demon souls when it first came out all that time ago. None of them were ever GREAT games. They were okay, and you know it. Dopamine release upon beating a, usually, buggy boss (“it’s a feature!”) doesn’t make a good game This is bland, mostly empty, with mediocre graphics (for something “next gen”. I play lots of indie games, but they don’t call themselves “next gen” and charge you next gen prices). I dob’t understand mob mentality, wanting to praise this just tot feel like they belong to a group, get that dopamine release. Man, if this is “the future of gaming” i’m going to need to hoard current and old gaming systems and games because we are in for so even blander and more mediocre days my friends. Stop being controlled by over-hype, and FOR THE LOVE OF GOD stop becoming fanboys that ignore all the bad and protect big ass companies as if they’ll ever notice you or thank you for shilling. Had to put such a low grade to compensate for those damn fanboys that put 10/10 without ever thinking what a 10/10 means.

monkeyDboofy,"the game is fun but I really just came here to talk about the low reviews. Some of the low reviews have very valid points. But a lot of low reviewers want their hand held, others are just dumb. What's that you say? No quest's you say? no story you say? I suppose your right, the game does not have a mini map telling you exactly where all of your side quest's are, or a submenu under the mini map telling you exactly what it is your supposed to do for the side quest. Why is that? Because the game is challenging you to figure it tf out. Use those few brain cells of yours to play the game, after all you have to be able to read to get the story in this game. There is a story being told not directly but environmentally and within literally every item in the game. Also if the game is too hard for you I don't think that's a valid criticism, I beat the game (no im not the only one who has beaten the game) and lo and behold its not that hard. The game definitely challenges you at times, but there seems to be quite a few gamers out there who have never heard of a challenge. I love the variety of different builds, I love the combat, I love the world they have built. All in all a great game and am hyped for dlc!",10,2023-07-20,PLAYSTATION 5

It's well designed, there is main content, hidden content.. you get to make decisions..

gvn91,"Elden Ring, my first venture into the Souls series and from this particular gaming development company, surpassed all my expectations. As a non-Souls player, I embarked on this game with no prior experience or knowledge of its difficulty. However, it quickly became my favorite game of all time due to its immersive campaign, incredible characters, and unparalleled gameplay. The game offers a rewarding sense of progression as you grow stronger to confront a vast open world teeming with formidable enemies. Overcoming challenges that seemed insurmountable before was an immensely satisfying experience. The world itself was a marvel to explore, requiring you to piece together fragments of a puzzle to unlock new areas. The sheer scale of the map left me awestruck, and the game's emphasis on exploration was mind-blowing. Elden Ring's rewarding nature truly captivated me. What sets Elden Ring apart from many modern games is its departure from the online service model and complete absence of microtransactions. You purchase the game as a whole, and it delivers exactly what it promises. While it may not boast the level of realism seen in games using the Unreal Engine 5, its visual presentation was still remarkably beautiful and satisfying. Reflecting on my experience with Elden Ring, I long to erase my memory of it just so I could relive the awe and surprise it brought me. It truly is a game that leaves a lasting impression. If I were to suggest areas for improvement, I would express a desire for expanded multiplayer options. I would love the opportunity to venture through the game alongside a party of friends. Additionally, updated graphics and improved character movements for the next generation would enhance the game's overall experience. However, it is important to note that these minor shortcomings did not hinder my overall enjoyment. From this point forward, I proudly consider myself a devoted fan of FromSoftware.",10,2023-07-20,PLAYSTATION 5

Isteffy,"""Exceeded the hype but not without faults"" Watching a lot of user reviews here, shockingly giving this a 7.9, I can see that the negative reviews fall into two different camps; the people who thought this game was too hard and rated it poorly for that by either blaming themselves or the game, and salty DS fans who are so angry that this isn't DS 4. Both of these types of reviews should be ignored. This game is a bit like my previous profession software engineering; you have a task that must be completed and whether not it is difficult or not entirely depends on how you utilize the tools at your disposal. The reviewers who thought this game was too hard often did not properly utilize their tools or built their character, like software, on a poor foundation which led to poor scalability, making their life more and more difficult as the game progressed. This has been one of the best gaming experiences of my life. I have not been addicted to a game like this since I was a child. The world itself is one of the most beautiful I've ever seen with secrets behind every corner. The game has over 77 unique and epic bosses and even 60 hours in, I have not seen the game get sloppy like I did in, say, the last chapter of Divinity 2. Being an open world, the game gives you multiple ways to tackle a single task allowing for a huge diversity of builds and playstyles. The sheer amount of weapons, weapon abilities, and spells are jaw dropping. Hats off.",10,2023-07-12,PLAYSTATION 5
amwazdraws,"I really love Fromsoftware and I loved Elden Ring and platinumed it, but this game has some issues. The game is just way too big. I would have prefered a smaller game with good and unique bosses, instead of forgettable minibosses scattered all around the game, placed at the end of the dungeons and mines. The bosses in the Late Game are not good and it doesn't feel satisfying to defeat them. Malenia is one of the worst bosses Fromsoftwarte designed. Only a few bosses come close to the quality of the Dark Souls III bosses (Mogh, Placidusax, Rykard...). The design of the Legacy Dungeons is a bit weird. Why not just stick with the more linear design of the levels like in the Dark Souls games? I mostly enjoyed the startings areas. Can't wait for the Expansion and I hope they will improve on the boss quality.",8,2023-07-10,PLAYSTATION 5
dr-kenobi,"Доволі overrated, як на мене. При зачистці всіх однотипних нудних дандженів (а як можна очікувати іншого від людей, які грали в соулси), боси тривіалізуються просто до рівня кежуал (навіть без спіріт саммонів, з ними це просто імба). Зрозуміло що це робить тайтл більш accessible для загалу й відповідно він принесе більше кеша, але все ж тоді варто зберегти якийсь баланс для досвідчених соулс-геймерів, інакше просто виходить класична ґрайнд-бігалка і вся магія соулсборну помирає в зародку. Не варто було й Мартіну віддавати лор, те в чому Міядзакі і команда завжди були дуже сильні.

Істинно гру року варто було віддавати Богу. Єдине, що дійсно заслуговує поваги в цьому тайтлі це левел дизайн (лише не дандженів), те що в білд світу вкладено тони годин кранчів дуже і дуже помітно, але на жаль цього не достатньо, щоб бути досконалою грою.",6,2023-07-10,PLAYSTATION 5
NEO-OUTSIDER,"Elden Ring is the definitive experience of a souls-like game. You can play hours non stop by is addicting formula. Pros: The combat is very diverse, each build feels different and also great. The story/ lore is very rich and keeps the essence in which the world tells you the story. The games motives you to explore every area and you are heavily rewarded with great weapons or by finding new characters which contributes to lore. The art design compensates the graphics making it a great visual experience Bosses are well designed artistically and they also delivered great combat experience. The best aspect that it solves are the checkpoints that are near the boss fights, different from dark souls that you need to restart from a bonfire that was not near the boss fight. Cons: The game has not the best graphics. You can get lost some times so you should look to a guide even though is not necessary. Technical issues( i mean how the game was designed), like the fall damage of the horse, how can easily can be quests be lost frustrates me, etc, Even though you get used to it.",10,2023-07-09,PLAYSTATION 5

lordalaric,"As long-time FromSoft fan, I can safely say this game is good. Not great, not a masterpiece in any sense but definitely good. The game for some reason is open world, meaning there are vast expanses of empty land for naught to do but traipse through and kill mobs of enemies. The art direction is brilliant, the music is also amazing but sadly this game sorely lacks that hopeless (Dark Souls 1), Melancholic (DS 2 ) or apocalyptic(DS 3) atmosphere that make FromSoft titles stand out. I sunk 60 hours into the game and once I realized that the game simply does not respect my time I had to cut my losses and move on.",0,2023-07-05,PLAYSTATION 5
hazukimio,"Elden Ring is more of a work of art to me than a game. In map design, combat system, effect of the performance, and artistic style, Elden Ring deserves the title of the game of the year.

You lizard-brain skitter through it. Difficulty is nothing special, same enemy double standards seen in every game. Damage sponge enemies vs 2-3 hits = dead. Homing attacks and projectiles with massive hit boxes vs your lame limited move set. Hardcore gaming has become a joke. Developers and publishers would rather reskin, repackage, and crank out what was successful before then dare try to innovate. And that sums up AAA games for over a decade.",2,2023-07-04,PLAYSTATION 5

While alot of deaths do feel pretty unearned, the aspect of difficulty still does alot for the overall experience, even though it's a bit excessive at times (sekiro did this better in my opinion, by having a revive and not insta-killing you by falling of a cliff). Elden ring's massive amount of content provides one of the best and lengthiest experiences available in gaming. Though sadly without a search engine, alot of the most impressive spectacles will be missed by a gamer playing it blind (the right way to play these games), but when you do occasionally find something incredible, it feels amazing.

StretchyFerret,"Hard to put down why this game was so good for me. Suffice to say I usually manage one play through of the best single player games, but for Elden Ring I ended up doing 5 runs across 4 character classes across about 250 hours. A key part of it is the fairness of the game. You could, if you were good enough, complete the game without levelling your character at all. There's only one difficulty setting, which I love as It really creates a sense of community with other players. Similarly there are no random loot drops or similar, instead every weapon and every character is exactly where the game designers intended. It is hard, particularly at the outset whilst you figure things out, but that is seriously mitigated by the open world design - if you can't beat a boss or area there will be an area where your skill level matches the enemies where you can level up. But crucially all of the content is so consistently good that this doesn't feel like grinding but exploring and making your character stronger. And the reward for stretching yourself is real with powerful items stashed away in the areas you are scared to tread. The combat mechanics have a beautiful and brutal precision. I saw one reviewer desribe later boss battles like a dance and that feels right. I had a misspent youth in various Muay Thai and boxing gyms and this style of combat appeals to me so much more than the button smooshing, mob exploding experience of some games. I would fall asleep at night with my mind racing through how to improve my build with a very fair and interesting system. The story is opaque and strange, more of a imprint of past events which you uncover fragments of as you explore. You can play without multiplayer entirely and the game will be wonderful but when you do start using it there is a subtle but genuine sense of shared joy in the movements and actions of fellow players. There are no microtransactions. You feel as if the content and experience are utterly paramount to the game designers and producers. In a world where the board room permeates the texture of so many games the sheer authenticity and purity of Elden Ring is an absolute joy.",10,2023-06-22,PLAYSTATION 5

JSeKour,"These FROMSOFTWARE games have struck a chord with a particular type of gamer - and I daresay, not a classic gamer that have explored various genres. There's a writer named Dan Brown, whose fiction novels garnered A LOT of critical acclaim; but amongst those of us who enjoy a good sleuth, and have much experience with various crafts-people of the trade, we knew a charlatan when we saw him. See, Dan Brown relied a on a 'rinse-and-repeat' style of writing - a 'writing-by-numbers', if you will. In essence, each story contained the same characters, plot devices, story arcs and climaxes. It was cheap - and, might I add, intellectually insulting. But despite the objective criticism of connoisseurs, the media machine was fully behind Dan Brown, and the Asch Phenomenon claimed another victory. So, too, to FROMSOFTWARE's rinse-and-repeat genre. I refunded all of my FS purchases safely within the allotted window before I was stuck with an intellectual insult. ""Souls-like"" should NOT be 'a thing'; more appropriately for the RPG-genre, ""Fable-like"", or ""Witcher 3-like"" - but this farcical, reskinned money-grab does not deserve a category unto itself. The power of marketing (and mass persuasion) indeed....",0,2023-06-20,PLAYSTATION 5

Combat is also basic and not fluid compared to recent releases like Sekiro and Nioh 2. compare that with an actual open world game like Skyrim, it has an exciting intro, great music, great map design, many cities, fleshed out lore, a lot of random npc encounters outside of villages. Skyrim is just a complete game and Elden ring lacks basic elements like overworld music and story.

tensioly,"Tras más de un año de su salida y 110 horas de juego (acabando con nivel 155) he podido acabar la última obra de From Software. Este difícil soulslike ha sido toda una experiencia y me ha marcado personalmente. Con un mundo abierto absurdamente grande, y multitud de ciudades, mazmorras y enemigos distintos han conseguido una inmersión, una libertad y una cantidad de cosas por hacer que resulta en un juego muy extenso y completo. El mapa está muy cuidado y repleto de detalles y cada cosa en el mundo tiene su propósito y contexto dentro del mismo. La historia dentro del mundo y todo lo que lo rodea rebosa de creatividad y posee una complejidad y un tacto excelentes, con personajes memorables y arcos de personajes con muy buenos argumentos. En cambio, para entender todo lo que rodea las Tierras Intermedias hay que leerse la descripción de todos los objetos y enlazar muchas historias, lo que hace muy difícil de entender la historia si no es con un vídeo explicativo; al igual que con la mayoría de misiones secundarias, que aunque son interesantes son muy difíciles de terminar ya que no hay nada que te indique los pasos a seguir. La jugabilidad ha obtenido la perfección dentro de la saga, siendo muy fluida, completa y llena de posibilidades con las distintas armas y hechizos de los que dispones. Los distintos enemigos y jefes gozan de una gran personalidad y puesta en escena y generalmente un set de movimientos muy variado, siendo algunos de ellos icónicos e inolvidables. Entrando en el apartado audiovisual, el mejorable apartado técnico ha ido puliéndose conforme ha avanzado el tiempo y, aunque sigue sin ser perfecto, existiendo aún realentizaciones y pop in, está mucho mejor que en su salida. Lo que sí que me parece magistral es el apartado artístico, dotando al mundo de un arte onírico del que pocos juegos han conseguido hacer gala. Al mismo nivel no está el apartado sonoro, que me ha decepcionado para lo que me esperaba, al igual que la banda sonora, ya que, sin ser mala, habiendo visto los otros trabajos del estudio me esperaba algo más memorable. Como último y más notorio punto negativo debo mencionar la repetición de enemigos y jefes a lo largo del juego, ya que para cubrir todo el terreno han tenido que repetir innumerables veces los mismos, algo que hubiera preferido que quitasen y redujesen el tamaño del mapa. A pesar de ello, en mi opinión Elden Ring es un juegazo y será recordado como uno de los mejores juegos de mundo abierto de la historia y lo recomiendo a todos quienes quieran jugar un juego desafiante.9,4/10 (03/2023)",9,2023-06-06,PLAYSTATION 5

Kostas_Spirou,"Elden Ring is the most Ambitious FromSoftware title to date. For the first half of the game, I was blown away, the Open World is huge and there are so many things you can do in it, it's absolutely groundbreaking, there are so many areas to explore, a huge map full of castles, ruins, dungeons and cities... even underground cities! It's honestly crazy, this game is insanely big, it has everything you'd expect from a Medieval Open World RPG. Although the gameplay is identical to previous FromSoftware titles, there are indeed some minor tweaks and changes, new magic spells, a ton of additional weapons to use in combat and many more. Summons are also useful, and quite necessary in some cases. As for the lore, it's pretty deep and interesting for the most part, the game always encourages the player to keep learning new things via exploring or reading. The boss fights are spectacular, most of them look phenomenal, their movesets are varied and the animations look gorgeous, however, the game is unbalanced, with some questionable difficulty spikes specifically towards the endgame. And lastly, there's a lot of recycled content, all the dungeons look the same, many boss fights are reused, some areas look identical but with different colors... there's a lot of copy paste, which isn't necessarily a very bad thing, but it's worth mentioning. Elden Ring is the true evolution of the genre, an amalgamation of everything FromSoftware has done the past few years, and the ultimate souls game.

EricHarmon,"Elden Ring is a massive game with challenging boss fights and enemy Encounters. Like other Souls games it has a learning curve it's not a game you can just jump into and start ""winning"". You have to take your time and learn the game mechanics and enemy attacks and figure out how to avoid them. Also take you time to explore and find new weapons and abilities that can help you in combat. Do this and you'll have a great time with Elden Ring. As it's not a game that will hold your hand. The game has so much to see and explore. And there's a lot of ways to customize your character to create cool builds. It provides a great challenge that feels rewarding, the world is full of interesting sights and encounters, and the combat is fun and thrilling. My only criticism is the Quest design and the lack of hints for finding certain npcs or completing certain objectives. I had to refer to a guide several times just to figure out where to go. While I like that there isn't much hand holding in the game I got annoyed when I missed an objective and an npc died because the game did not provide enough information. The Dark Souls Quest design does not work well here in Elden Ring because you have a huge open world as opposed to smaller interconnected levels. Which makes it less obvious of where to go. But despite that Elden Ring still ends up being one of the best games of 2022. And my personal top 10 games of all time. Due to the sheer amount of locations, weapons, abilities and boss encounters all that make Elden Ring an epic experience.",10,2023-05-21,PLAYSTATION 5

alonehub,"One of the best games I've ever played. It's endlessly brutal but gives you a lot of options to come back to a boss stronger. If you're stuck, explore the beautifully crafted, atmospheric map and level up, use the life-saving spirit ashes, or get help from a friend. The game respects your intelligence, dropping you off in a world with no guide, allowing you to explore and make your own path. I'm sure everyone's experience is different. I couldn't believe how big the map is, it just opens up more and more as you go along. This also features some of the most exhilarating boss fights I've played, and the forgiving placement of grace sites allows you to keep trying without having to run through a portion of a castle, fighting enemies, and losing your health before you even get to the boss again. The story line is a little obtuse, you'd definitely need to do some extra homework to fully grasp all the things at play here, but it's all secondary. What comes first is the art design, atmosphere, and addictive gameplay.",10,2023-05-18,PLAYSTATION 5

CnPx98,The game is extremely rushed and full of issues which lets the good sides down. For example the Ps5 version still hasn't even got vibration support! The game has been out a year now and they still haven't bothered. Instead they will patch a rune glitch which is slower then killing a bird then resetting at a site of grace. PvP in this game is terrible compared to every single other souls game. The ashes of war are extremely unbalanced. It's so easy just to win by doing something completely broken. Summoning has completely killed the game for me. Instead of them being a slight boost to distract the boss for a couple seconds so you can quickly sort yourself out. Instead they grab the bosses agro for ages so you can get half their health down if not more and have little to no risk while doing so?! Because the bosses are built around this mechanicthey are a mess if you don't use them. The open world map was amazing and some of the best work from software has done but the enemies are just copy and pasted several times you get sick of seeing the same ones. Even most of the bosses are just regular enemies with a health bar at the bottom of the screen! Including the same health. You get rats and countless other enemies in some places which have 100 HP and a rat in another place with 1000 with the exact same texture! Why didn't they change the texture to match the environment and then change its health so it feels more consistent. This is across the hole game. Within the 1st couple zones you would have already thought more or less everything with a few exceptions. It's just gonna be different health bars from then on. The story isn't bad. The lore is easier to follow in Elden Ring. I thought the fingers looked cringe thou. Faith has seen a huge upgrade making faith builds actually more viable. There is a ton of spells to choose from aswell. Ashes of war seem like a good idea but in practice I think it would have been better if they had a few weapons with a set ash of war that you can't change. That way the weapon would be balanced around it. If you can throw it on anything you get broken weapons that are far to op. All in all Elden Ring would have been good if it wasn't rushed out the door. And they didn't have summoning.,5,2023-05-06,PLAYSTATION 5

The environments are just full of character and the locations are some of the most unique in any video game ever. There are endless builds you can use.

rp36,"The high critic score is a case study in what happens when hype builds for so long. Similarly with all these 10/10 ratings. More and more people simply cannot think for themselves. This is arguably the worst soulslike game (better than DS2). The open world is large, but lifeless. The exploration can be good, and really does shine when you come across legacy dungeons, but the open world is such a waste of time. The bosses are a smidge better than those of DS2, but there are so many with so few having high quality. The delayed attacks are so frequent it makes fighting jarring. Not difficult, just jarring and lacking in rhythm. I've platinumed Bloodborne, Sekiro, DS3, and DS2 (and completed DeS and DS1)...this is my least favourite by far. Though I can see how on an objective level it's superior to DS2.",7,2023-04-29,PLAYSTATION 5

holznudelhauer2,"Elden Ring has been one, if not the biggest disappointment in my time gaming by now. While the world certainly is well thought out and beautifully designed, the game is poorly optimised. You cant take one step without running into any sorts of pop ups or frame drops at some points. (luckily the frame rate drops have almost completely been solved by now) Nethertheless the game does not care a **** about telling you where to go or what to do, so that you will be stranded in this gigantic world without a clue on where to go, which will then result in countless deaths due to you running into enemies which are way to overpowered. And once you find the right NPC to move on, you will be met with a cryptic information dump, which cant be processed quick enough, so that you will almost certainly end up on Youtube trying to figure out what the F to do. In my over 80 hours with this game I have only been able to kill the first five story bosses. 80 HOURS! And I am not even counting all the time used to look up things on the internet related to this game. I don‘t want to spend the little time I have left of the day being torn in half over and over again by a boss, which took me an additional 3 hours to find. The overall gameplay loop just consists of running around trying to level up, getting side tracked and finding a random side boss and finally trying to kill named boss for the next few attempts of dying, respawning, running back (whilst being constantly annoyed by regular enemies on the way) and then being killed by the boss again. For anybody who hasn‘t anything to do and has 200+ hours of free time: This is your game. Otherwise I can not recommend buying Elden Ring. Yes, the story is certainly great, the boss designs are cool, but it all comes down to the same frustrating same gameplay loop. Overall not a great game. If you do still consider buying a other Souls Game get Demons Souls Remake, it is way better without the open world aspect. And one last thing: This isn‘t meant to be personal in any kind of way. If you like Elden Ring its cool to me, but please try to accept my opinion on the game aswell.",0,2023-04-27,PLAYSTATION 5

dangerfar,"I'm frankly pretty surprised how widely acclaimed this game is. The huge world is devoid of anything interesting other than battles, the score is terrible other than a few standout bossfights and in the open world score is often bad enough to become actually grating, and there's nothing resembling the faintest bit of interesting story or lore here as there are no concepts in it fleshed out enough or given enough background to be even vaguely compelling. The combat, though it is wonderfully varied in the way you can approach it, in practice ends up becoming fairly tedious b/c the game is challenging enough that you don't really have time for experimentation/exploration (unless you can stand a lot of repetition), you just need to optimize a build and some builds (particularly magic) are spammy and repetitive. And again b/c of the annoying repetition that comes with wandering around and dying, you end up having to look things up to get sufficient tools to make meaningfully progress to actually open up the places you can go. Thus having such a large open world becomes fairly meaningless as the joy from exploration is **** out of it. On the one hand the open world and and leveling system with diverse possibilities and the very impressive variety of enemies and environments is very attractive and makes me want to like the game, and has driven me enough to spend some 50 hours with it and at times really enjoy the experience (mostly when I was able to explore without dying constantly and the world was still new). But on the other the above detractors end up adding up to a rather drab experience overall where I feel like I'm running around without much interesting to do. Compared with say Skyrim which has rich possibilities to explore the world outside of combat with a sensational score to go along with it, playing games like this just feel fairly empty. But I guess they have a large audience. Sadly it seems I'm just not one of them.",6,2023-04-26,PLAYSTATION 5

I would have loved to see more of its lore, and experience more of the game, but with my poor motor skills and working memory it's simply not possible. I know this was not made for gamers like me.

JH_Money,"A very fun souls game set in the open world area of the lands between. There is a lot of content in this amazing game including a 36 side questlines 6 known endings and a large variety of bosses, landscapes and weapons. My main issue with this game is that it wasn't longer as if you don't do any optional content the game is very short with only a few mandatory bosses, but i think this is balanced out by the increasing level of the bosses which requires you to do a little bit of exploration and grinding. Also exploration is awarded by weapons, lore and more content.

PringleBrule,"Elden Ring's open world and bosses may come across differently to players depending on what they're used to. The exploration is some of the best in any open world game I've played. While the scale of this aspect may be overwhelming at first, it's a rewarding experience that also makes the game more accessible, without skimping FromSoftware veterans on the staples they've com to expect from the Soulsborne series. My one criticism is the difficulty spike in the back half of the game, which can make it feel like the clock is has been turned back on your leveling progress. Late game enemies and bosses have much higher damage output compared to previous Souls titles. It puts the game in this weird place where on New Game (or ""Journey"" 1 as they call it), the first half of the game feels well balanced, and the second half is tough as nails. When you get to NG+, the first half of the game feels too easy, but the second half feels closer to the way you would've wanted it to feel on your first playthrough. My only wish is that they had ironed out this balance a bit more, so that the game's difficulty had a smother progression instead of starting off slow and then flooring it halfway in. Despite it flaws, this is probably one of my favorite games I've ever played. There's quite a lot to unpack and it's best enjoyed without rushing in or having expectations of what you're going to get out of it. Everyone's experience is going to be different. If you don't like spending time trying to figure out obscure clues to access the secret areas and bosses this game has to offer, there's nothing wrong with looking up a guide here and there (and in some cases it's quite necessary). For longtime players of FromSoftware's games this will more than likely be a treat, and for players new to Soulslike games this one is a great introduction with a lot of fun to be had.",9,2023-04-09,PLAYSTATION 5

The adrenaline you get from the fights is so weird feeling, and after some Boss-fights my heart was thumping so hard and I was shaking so much I thought I was going to die, which was a strangely fun and felt especially rewarding after the 30 or so attempts it took to kill Radahn, but it still has a few ""small"" issues like re-using bosses, I didn't mind but I can see why that would be annoying to some.

autosag1979,This game has lower design levels but the Bosses! the bosses are crap! The best game of the souls like genre was definitely Bloodborne because it looked and felt somewhat unique. I wasn't a huge Sekiro fan but at least there they tried to shake up the visuals.,0,2023-03-20,PLAYSTATION 5

darthcooper,"My reviews are always based on fun and I did like the game but it is very confusing and very big. It is a massive open-world souls game with a lot of ways to play but you have to grind a lot to level up and there is virtually zero direction. The game runs well and is beautiful on PS5, loading times are almost zero it loads really quickly. However, I felt totally lost after a couple of hours but continued exploring, grinding, rinse, and repeat. Eventually, I managed to get to the Academy after 40 hours but I spent almost double the hours trying to kill ""Rennala, Queen of the Full Moon"". There is only so much a person can take doing the same thing over and over again and getting zero results. This game is not as much fun as I had hoped as all your doing is the same rinse and repeat which becomes tedious. If you want a game that doesn't overwhelm you try Bloodborne.",7,2023-03-17,PLAYSTATION 5
AustinHancock,"TL;DR: This game raises the standard of what a ""10"" is. I understand that this game is not for everyone. It is punishing, especially for my first FromSoftware game. For the first 6 hours or so I hated the game. It felt unfair and unlike anything I'd ever seen (not in a good way). When it clicked though, it clicked HARD. Every movement you make must be articulated and it is rare that you can defeat a boss through hacking and slashing. There are other games I have given a 10, but all of those need to move out of the way, because I did not know a game could be this good.",10,2023-03-17,PLAYSTATION 5
JMI,"Elden Ring is the antithesis of the bloated, over produced, unimaginative side quest stuffed open world game that has become so popular. It feels like a true adventure - you against the world. It’s hard but you’re free to seek easier areas of the game and come back to harder parts later. Over 100 hours in and I am still at the edge of my seat. The intensity of combat when you are right at the edge of your skill level is really something. Adrenaline pumping. Yes sometimes is can be frustrating so it best suits individuals with a persistent attitude and a desire to overcome difficult challenges. It’s probably not for everyone but it has been a great experience for me personally. I love this game. I also like games that focus on story - they are very different games and thankfully we don’t have to choose only one thing in life to enjoy.",10,2023-03-17,PLAYSTATION 5

SebboBastian,"first of, this is my first souls game ever. I always been interested mainly because of the art and bizarre vibe where nothing is like you think it should. But the main thing that kept me away is the degree of difficulty. I play a lot of games, always solo. All from big AAA to smaller indie games and I have nothing against a challenge but I am not the one that want to repeat the same boss over and over and learn the exact the movement pattern like a rhythm game. I want my adventure and then move to the next one, don´t have time to become the best for a specific game when three more waiting to be played. But with all that said I felt that I needed to test this one and I loved it! Sure I had to level up like a madman to get through some bosses but still, I loved the exploration, to never know what strange thing waiting around the next corner. It ended up that I visited the whole damn map and probably did most things you could do. So here comes some pros and cons.. + Few open world games can really surprise me and want me to explore. Before it was probably only zelda breath of the wild that gave me the same tension. so this is super rare. Not like all the copy paste games ala ubisoft where you know almost exactly whats up around the next corner even in a newly area. + the twisted art direction. Sure its not the latest high tech materials and vfx but the art direction is super unique and thats more important then shiny god of war tiled materials. + So much love put into areas thats not on the main story line. Areas that is super easy for the player to miss. - online mode. Yeah I know this is the one of the main thing about the game, but I turned it off directly. To see other players jump around,, glowing messages all over the world and so on ruined the loneliness and the vulnerability vibe, I want this to be only mine adventure. But easy fix, just turn it of. Sure, you will miss all the hints buts its up to you to explore even more now. - A bit flat NPC:s. Just standing there and say their lines and then not so much more. Would prefer a bit more complex ones, moving around, doing their thing.",9,2023-03-16,PLAYSTATION 5

Helix__006,"20230314 updat_e Finally, 2022 game of the year, gave to an open world game that you can only walk. And thanks dislikers, i decide to change 3 to 1. And i can say the 2022 game of the year should be stray, or god of war ragnarok. Media are all **** dogs, the are not gamer, just zombie. 2022 review Don't play this game! The author says he doesn't play the game himself! Your IQ is being insulted! If you don't use ashes of war, don't use additional vials, the difficulty of the bosses is unreasonable, the bosses has too much blood and increases unnecessary difficulty. All bosses play the same way, that is to roll in 0.x seconds before he drops the knife, which only increases fatigue and has no fun. Bloodborne is better!",1,2023-03-14,PLAYSTATION 5
HeitorCampos,"It´s not perfect but the experience of playing for the first time is unforgetable. I can´t say a lot that haven´t been said already, but the replayability and combat get way too much hate. The replayability isn´t that much of a big deal considering the fact that the game relies so much on the combat. The combat is great, I don´t like to be that guy, but honestly most complaints about it make it seem like people who complain about it seem like they didn´t learn how to play it properly.",10,2023-03-13,PLAYSTATION 5

Milough,"The user scores for this game are a **** joke. All of the 0s here are from angry gamers that walked in expecting a watered-down open world with forgettable, one-dimensional plot points and characters and simple cut and dry storytelling. This game is not that. If you’ve played any of the dark souls, you know a little bit of what to expect. The lore/story is never explained directly; instead the enemies and NPCs you encounter all contain a little of the narrative, like little story biscuits that you have to digest in your own way, and absorb the overall narrative through item descriptions and short exposé. It’s a different method of game design to be sure, but just because your brain is too small to appreciate it doesn’t mean it’s bad. Not every game has to be AC Valhalla or Far Cry 5. The combat is brutal, sure, but that’s the point. You have to find a way to overcome challenging enemies. The world is varied and absolutely massive to explore, sometimes the long cave with the vicious mini-boss doesn’t yield worthwhile loot, but the real loot is the triumph itself. This experience isn’t exactly for everybody, but to say that it’s a 0/10 is extremely dishonest. Even if it’s not your cup of tea, it has to be at least a 5.",9,2023-03-06,PLAYSTATION 5
netbattler15,I had flirted with playing Fromsoft games for a few years before this game came out. It had played Bloodborne a bit and bounced off of it before reaching any major bosses. I had generally played games on an easier difficulty because I didn't enjoy the struggle. Elden Ring changed that. This game did a good job of always giving me something to do to get better and overcome every main story boss and many of the side bosses. The online community got me through all of it as well. This game made it possible for me to enjoy challenge for it's own sake by proving to me that I could overcome the challenges within this game.,10,2023-03-06,PLAYSTATION 5

I mean that is a fact. bad framerate, camera hiccups, pop-ins and generally unacceptable graphics for current gen. The world looks great but too many technical errors alone prevent this from perfection, period. The other half a point comes from the frustrating difficulty. I know it's supposed to be hard but there are some cheap deaths and and can really make you mad. Alas, somehow, it is the most fun game ever played. Great atmosphere, combat, story, music etc. I did get the platinum trophy that was an accomplishment was sad when it ended and glad i won't be breaking anything out of frustration.

DarkSiren,"Didn't like it. I don't understand how this game got as much hype as it did. I've been playing open-world games for over a couple decades so I can tell you that this game isn't what it boldly makes itself out to be. Don't let the visuals fool you. The graphics are great - it's visually stunning yes but that's its only appeal. The overall gameplay is underwhelming and unimaginative and dull - the open world is bland and soulless. No distinction between NPC behavior. All NPCs you encounter seem to share the same hostile AI. The bosses are ridiculously overpowered from the start which makes combat in the game feel unbalanced. There are no quests and no clear objectives. You basically roam around aimlessly and get into frequent random fights. There seems to be a bit of bias with all the positive reviews as they most likely come from hardcore, devoted fans of the franchise. This feels more like an unpolished beta rather than a finished fleshed-out game. It would be an insult to compare this game to titles like Skyrim and the Witcher. Final verdict - The Elden ring is shallow and overrated. If you're looking for rich and engaging gameplay, I don't recommend.",2,2023-02-22,PLAYSTATION 5
BIissfulGamer,"Absolutely amazing game. The graphics are nice, the gameplay, the difficulty, the consistency. Some of these negative reviews are so stupid. You se people saying that well ""Oh the game is too hard 0/10"" Well then shame on you for spending your money on a game you obviously researched nothing about! Also people will complain **** changes it up too much and is inconsistent then when they find a consistent game say the exact opposite. Also people who seem to obviously not know this is soulsborne due to doing absolutely no research pick on it for primary features of soulsbornes. People are mad that the game isn't insanely linear and just assume there is absolutely no story instead of actually putting in the effort to uncover it. Again, people complain that it's hard. People say that the game is empty which doesn't make sense because there are enemies and dungeons everywhere. I guess they are just mad that it's not like the mainstream games where it's brimming with random NPCs instead of brimming with challenges. I also see people call the graphics awful and I'm like ""Are you sure you're reviewing the right game?"" People will also say this game is a ripoff of the previous soulsgames. That's the whole damn point. Elden Ring was created to perfect the souls formula not recreate it. People also say this is a downgrade which is strange considering I quite clearly recall the Demon Souls, the progenitor of the souls formula to be the first of it's kind. But mostly it's just because of people raging because of a skill issue. Another thing is this game isn't for casuals. Fromsoftware will NEVER add a difficulty system because the whole point is to get good as a gamer. YOU should've been aware of that before you decided to play this game. The idea is that no matter how good you are they want you to get good at the game. To grow. That is the purpose of Soulsbornes. To grow as a gamer.

Soo many different ways to play, spells, and ways to gear yourself to challenge the many bosses and unique enemies the game throws at you.

The open world being actually open without a million markers seems to not appeal to many, ig people just like being told where to go and what to do. With the ui and ux that image of ""if ubisoft made elden rings ux"" speaks for itself. All these negative reviews as well are worded as if the people played the game for a maximum of 2 hours and never again. Of course ui and controls are gonna be bad when you have not had the time to get used to them.

I prefer the more contained maps the previous games had. But still just seeing how many great looking castles and dungeons FS could make just makes you going.

P-taH,This game is mind blowingly stupid. You will die a 1000 times and lose your stuff before anything significant happens. I cannot understand how this pile of crap got game of the year. The combat mechanics are absolute trash. This game is just another version of bloodborne or dark souls so why is there so much hype about it? Nothing new or creative.

An open world that you decide if you finish someone's story or not. Apart from the fact that an improvement in performance has been noticed, I could not run it properly with my previous graphics card. Now I can run it to spare. I've already had +300 hours and the game continues to make me fall in love. I find details that I hadn't found on my first trip.

KeeWii85,"Elden Ring is, without a shadow of a doubt, the best game I’ve played in LONG time. The last time I was this obsessed with a game was Breath of the Wild. Elden Ring has perfected the somewhat challenging aspect of an open world RPG. Many times the world can be huge but with very little to do throughout it. That is absolutely not the case here. Every single step of the way is filled with something. Wether it be an epic item, a new area with cool lore, or an insane boss battle, this game is PACKED with content. It took me about 85 hours to complete the game on my first run so yes, there is plenty to do. Another thing that some open world games have trouble with is story. They can focus so much on the gameplay ****, which isn’t bad, that they completely overlook making a good story to go with it. That is simply NOT the case with Elden Ring. While the story is in no way super obvious when you first play, just by playing it again or even watching a YouTube video, it’s easy to see how much story and lore is there. The base story is great but where it really hits home is the side stories. There are so many side quests each with their own story and lore. As you play through and see all these deep and emotional stories intertwine and unfold, it really changes your perspective on the entire game. Not to mention they’re just plain epic. Now the highlight of this game for is the bosses. With near countless bosses and dungeons/mini dungeons, you will constantly be saying “Oh my gosh what’s that?!” and “Holy cow this thing is awesome!!” as you fight through countless baddies. But of course what good are awesome bosses without a great way to fight them? That brings me to my next highlight, “PLAY STYLES!!” There are so many different ways to play this game. You can play as a simple swordsman who wants to restore peace to the Lands Between, a Sorcerer who seems to slay all evil, or even a Samurai bent on bringing world domination. By leveling up various attributes you can use specific weapons and creat the character of your dreams. With hundreds of swords, sorceries, and spells, skies the limit with what you can do. I for example just made a lighting based swordsman and it looks freaking epic. This also adds a TON of replay ability. You can start simple, using only swords and bows, and then on your next playthrough you can switch to magic. It will never get old. I’m conclusion, Elden Ring is a MASSIVE game that will keep you engaged for countless hours and captivate your heart in a matter of minutes. If you’ve never played a game from “Fromsoftwear” this is a great place to start. Is it hard? Absolutely. Does that also make you feel epic when you achieve something? Absolutely. And is this also the game of the year for a reason? Absolutely. The game encourages you to never give up and strive to be stronger. I HIGHLY recommend this game if you’ve never played it. And if you have, go play it again. It deserves it.",10,2023-01-26,PLAYSTATION 5
WowzifXD,"Elden ring supo como combinar la fórmula souls pero ahora en una experiencia de mundo abierto. El juego a diferencia de otros juegos de ""mundo abierto"" cuyo nivel de exploración es mínimo ya que el recorrido es en línea recta y no te la la libertad de explorar con libertad el mapa en elden ring no es así, no sólo el juego te deja ir por donde quieras, tambien hay recompensas por explorar motivando al jugador a seguir recorriendo el mundo, aunque el sistema de combate no es nada innovador y la mayoria de sus mecanicas son recicladas de los juegos anteriores como seria la mecanica de sigilo y los habilidad de saltar de sekiro, el frenetismo y las mazmorras de bloodborne y el sistema de combate de dark souls 3. Al principio sólo quería seguir explorando ya que era muy divertido, no obstante el juego recicla enemigos y jefes haciendo que muchos combates de jefes no se sientan tan memorables y a veces haciendolos monótonos. Tambien tuvo problemas en su salida a pc ya que muchas personas no pudieron disfrutarlo por estar mal optimizado, aunque es verdad que ya lo arreglaron y actualmente se puede jugar muy bien en pc, no deja de ser un error que tuvo en su salida. Mi conclusión de elden ring sería que es un mundo abierto ambicioso que buscaba ser lo más grande y lleno posible, pero acabo siendo un juego que le sobran muchas horas debido a lo repetitivo que se vuelve a medida que avanzas en el juego. Aunque no cabe duda que dentro de unos años muchas compañías de videojuegos intentarán copiar el éxito de elden ring en un intento de lograr lo que este consiguió. Lo que demuestra la influencia que tendrá de unos años. El juego está lejos de ser perfecto pero aún así lo recomiendo bastante tanto para fans de la saga como jugadores novatos.",8,2023-01-26,PLAYSTATION 5

The immersion and exploration are both top notch and I find myself lost in the world like some of my favorite open world games. The game is mechanically robust and executes on an interesting set of fights. World building is top notch and while FromSoft's storytelling is subtle, as usual, but I found it to be a step up from previous titles. The biggest thing is that Elden Ring feels like a game. It focuses on gameplay and wraps it into an interesting world with much to discover. It is challenging and I cannot recommend it more if you are a fan of Open World RPGs.",10,2023-01-20,PLAYSTATION 5

ChelseaFFC,"I really really enjoyed this game it's hard as hell being my 2nd souls-like game, without youtube I wouldn't really know where exactly to go or how to finish the quest I started because this game doesn't hold your hand at all. I understand it encourages explanation but sometimes a little help on where to go would be helpful. I chose a scorer because I heard for beginners it is the smoothest build to choose. I enjoyed the bosses, the design, music and art style were fantastic and there were many moments in this game that left me in awe. However, there were some bosses that were ridiculously OP *cough* *cough* Malenia but they were still enjoyable to play and satisfying to beat once you get the hand of the mechanics. I don't want to spoil too much of the game but I strongly recommend you play this game if you enjoy a challenge and appreciate great art style, exploration and game mechanics.",9,2023-01-19,PLAYSTATION 5
Lee_Godspeed,"Some of Fromsoftwares games I enjoy, whilst others I can take or leave it. Seeing some of the drivel people are writing is either because they haven't played it or it beat their favourite games to the awards. Who cares and get a grip. Looks like trash? Jaw dropping visuals as you exit from the tutorial. The world itself is so vast and scale is huge. Vertically and horizontally. The gameplay loop of GIT GOOD as some of the idiots put it, is fair and is incredibly satisfying when defeating a boss or tough enemy after a few goes. Reason I haven't scored it a perfect 10 is due to the screen tearing that often happens but it doesn't take me away from the experience and certainly runs fine apart from that.

This is not the RPG for you if you are looking for a deep story line with engrossing conversation, building relationships with npcs, etc. However, if you are looking for a deep challenge, the wonder of adventure/discovery, and fantastic mechanics this is a must play.

80sChild,"Another bag of flaming dog-sh**, press circle to win ""masterpiece"" from the worst thing to ever happen to action games: Hidetaka Miyazaki. This crap was an interesting oddity in 2011. Its just dated and pathetic in current year. Another game praised by the D-riding fanboys for being ""AmAzInG!"" as they play for 30 minutes, rage quit, uninstall and leave a 10/10 on Metacritic. Hows that 10-20% completion rate for your games feel Miyazaki? Lol enjoy it while it lasts d-bag. How this won Game Of The Year, I'll never understand. I can't write a spoiler review because, as far as I can tell there is no story to spoil. Played nearly 80 hrs before giving up because nothing makes sense. You just run around and fight random overpowered enemies without any context. You can't level up until you randomly get to a certain campfire and some girl spouts some nonsense dialogue and then you... wander out to kill more enemies. Ooops you got hit more than ONCE by a open world trash mob enemy so ""YOU DIED"" even though you're lvl 100 lmao. MaStErPiEcE! Wolves appear out of a whirlwind for... reasons. ??? Most of the bosses are easier to fight (literally beat around 10 of them on the first attempt) than the random trash mobs of the open world. If that doesn't scream untalented, garbage game design idk what does. You'd be hard pressed to notice a difference between Dark Souls and Elden Ring apart from a bland, empty open world; the combat is exactly the same. Same animations, same lock on system, same ""health vials"", same slow clunky ""combat"", same grind grind grind from 2011. Melee skills are pointless, block only SOMETIMES blocks and only certain shields can parry (with the worlds shortest timing window). You get maybe 2 attacks per weapon (Light and heavy, MaStErPieCe!) The lock on mechanic takes a full second to respond the players input. Combat: Lure enemy out because anything other than 1 v 1 likely means death. Roll>slash>roll>slashx3>block>roll roll roll. Watching paint dry is more exciting. There's nothing substantial here. You still can't engage multiple enemies, you just have to shuffle around, hitting them one at a time with the same TWO moves. Yawn. Combat is painfully slow and cumbersome. Even over-leveling by 20 levels, you can still be staggered by the same low level enemies, in the same amount of strikes. It doesn't make sense. Even in Dark Souls 1-3 and Demon Souls there was a feeling of progression as you went. Not here. I'm sure its something to make the game even more artificially difficult. Bosses are OP (that first one on horseback is hilariously difficult) and don't have stamina to deplete or cooldowns on their combos (they get combos, but not you lol). There are no mechanics to speak of and there's really no point to melee ""skills"", blocking or tactics as all fights, large and small, degrade to fighting them over and over, rolling around like an **** until their patterns are muscle memory. Its beyond tedious. I guess if nobody played my games to completion but still bought and over-praised them, I'd keep making abominable garbage too. You can either look up a YouTube tutorial on how to properly level up or just wander aimlessly and hope you eventually find the characters that can give you an edge. There's nothing in the game to even hint at where they might be or what you should do next. Just wander aimlessly and grind, one measly skill point at a time. I don't get the love for modern FromSoftware games. Sekiro and Elden ring are awful, slow, boring games with no story or direction, garbage combat and barely 10 or 20% completion rates (ie no one like this sh**). I finished Dark Souls and Demon Souls, enjoyed them. This modern FromSoft is horrible, they're just milking a decade old broken engine and formula. If you like artificially ""hard"" (ie old, broken/garbage/poorly made) games or just really enjoy 2011 Dark Souls ""combat"": this is your game. If you like innovative, modern and polished games with tight, fast paced combat and a story to drive the experience: This game is not for you. I gave Sekiro a chance, I tried Elden ring against my better judgement. I'm done with modern FromSoft. These are AWFUL games. I want my money back. I'd rate -100 if I could. Miyazaki is literally the worst thing to happen to gaming, EVER.",0,2023-01-01,PLAYSTATION 5
vicwolk,"This game has two flaws: Firstly, graphics are not the greatest for a PS5 game (yes, I expect better graphics for this generation, sorry). Secondly, and feel free to disagree, I think that you're punished too hard when missing a dialogue or simply not paying good attention to one. You end up missing an entire line of quests or simply getting lost. A simple log dialogue would suffice. I played offline and liked the immersion, so, looking up to revisit something that needed to be done was a little upsetting. And, if you let me worry about the little things a little further... Comparing in-store items with equiped ones should be a basic feature that is completely missed in the game. Had to take pictures all the time. That's all. The game is amazing.

The environmental storytelling, combined with the atmospheric world building and refined combat system just makes ma want to erase my brain and discover all of its facets all over again. The epic bosses are the icing on the cake. Mechanically challenging and accompanied by one of the best soundtracks I've ever heard in gaming. Not all of them live up to the standards of the better ones, but still have something unique going for them. Even if it's just a new combination of already learned mechanics. I never finished a souls game before and I liked this one so much, that I'm almost through Dark Souls 3 already and about to buy the Demon's Souls Remaster. 10/10 – we need more games like this, and less of uninspired, soulless (pun intended) products such as Call of Duty, Fifa or anything Ubisoft.",10,2022-12-26,PLAYSTATION 5
neighel1,"Elden Ring stands as the culmination of everything I loved about the team at Fromsoft, polished to near perfection. A complaint that frequents most FromSoft games comes from how cryptic they deliver their narrative; it's the same with this title. Despite this, the story is still engaging, and you will be stepping into one of the most exciting and rewarding video game experiences that I can recount. Elden Ring provides more than just spectacle and emphasizes the importance of discovery. Everyone who plays the game has their own unique experience and essentially creates their own personal adventure. Of course, you can't mention a FromSoft game without mentioning the Bosses. FromSoft has crafted some of its toughest challenges (despite some re-skins). ""Easily imitated, never recreated,"" no one can ever replicate the sense of accomplishment that defeating the boss has with the soul's games. If you feel discouraged by the difficulty or never touched a FromSoft game in your life, I urge you to take the plunge. FromSoft has created its most approachable experience to date. In the discussion of difficulty, try it out. You're meant to die a lot. With each death, you learn more; you know what moves to dodge and how to dodge them, and you learn the openings and find a rhythm for each attack; on each attempt, you get closer and closer until you find yourself getting half their health down without getting hit yourself. Then if you ever return to that boss, all the information and skills you've developed through experience come back essentially making fights easier. Elden Ring is once in a generation and genre-defining moment in gaming. The culmination of all FromSoft has created prior (shortcomings and issues in all) all wound together in a tightly constructed package that everyone should at least try.",9,2022-12-26,PLAYSTATION 5

NAYKEN,"It's a very delayed review because my monitor broke, but I see that fanboys and those who write reviews with money have raised this fiasco game to the level of unrivaled. Anyway, let's move on to our real unbiased review. Let's start with the mechanics as always, there is no innovation in mechanics, standard soul games, jumping is added and has almost no effect on the game. Open world was added to the game, but mechanically is there such a thing, the answer is no. The game is very big, there are incredibly many castles and dungeons you can visit, but they are all flat and empty inside. Let's start with the castles, when you start the game, you look around and see the incredible map and you start exploring, traveling and wandering around in castles that last a maximum of half an hour, yes, you did not hear wrong, the time you spend in castles is half an hour, including Lyndell! All of those incredibly designed castles are just images, empty castles with no design inside, filled with creatures and left. When I look at the old souls games, designs like DS 1 Anor Londo, DS 2 Drangleic castle are bigger and more detailed than all the castles in the Elden ring game combined. Ds 2 had this success despite being a half-open world, Elden ring is a huge empty world full of creatures. The only good thing about it is that it looks great artistically. I have explained the chapter and map designs together with the mechanics. Now let's look at the small innovations and whether they have an effect on the game. Let's start with the mount, we have a horse-like mount in the game, this mount allows us to travel around the whole world, we can do combat and boss fights in some places and it has no mechanical effect on the game. The things we do with the mount are very limited, don't expect something like Zelda or Shadow of the colossus. When I say Shadow of the colossus, they said that they were inspired by Shadow of the colossus before the game came out, there is nothing about it in the game. Since jumping was added, the platform was expected, which it should have been, but they didn't put it, the jumping mechanics look ridiculous even next to the games 30 years ago. Let's talk about dungeons, there are dungeon designs that are so terrible that they compete with Skyrim. You enter hundreds of dungeons throughout the game and except for a few, they are all similar designs. We have come to the end of our review and unfortunately Elden ring is not a good game at all. The same mechanics, open world game mechanics and design are not reflected in the game, nothing good except for the improved spells. Elden ring is the biggest fiasco of this year. 57/100 if we come to the score",5,2022-12-21,PLAYSTATION 5

krissmilne,"While the game has an excellent combat system with a wide array of flexibility. The games lack of quest tracking system is not clever or original, but an annoying inconvenience that will force almost every single player to Google aspects of the game as they go through. Perhaps this is deliberate to maintain the relevance of the game with online content and searches. The most frustrating part of the game is that quest lines are driven with vague minimal character dialogue that doesn't actually drive a story. This makes quest lines easily missable, and there's content and loot items that can be locked from the player if you make the wrong choice. As far as a game design goes, combat and difficulty, this is an excellent game, as far as large scale epic RPG is concerned, there's absolutely no story here, nothing to get connected to, nothing to be immersed in. It's a game that seems to have missed one of the most important aspects of game design.",2,2022-12-18,PLAYSTATION 5

gregphillip23,"This game is an absolute masterpiece. A breath of fresh air for me, a total departure from the many other open world games I have played in the best way possible. I absolutely love the combat, the world, the total ludicrous insanity of the enemies and bosses. Love the creativity. I have never had this much fun building a character that is completely my own, and I am looking forward to making more characters. I enjoyed that they made quests and objectives harder to follow than a normal open world game but the balance was too much on the hard side. It’s too difficult to follow quest lines and know where to talk to NPCs or what you should be doing next. The story is quite vague and hard to follow, jumping in and out over extended periods is virtually impossible, not so much as quest log. Given you are locked out of certain items if you progress too far without doing a quest, they should be easier to find and follow. I also felt a bit less engaged with the narrative than I felt I could be if I really grasped the story as I was playing. At times combat can be very annoying when you get stuck up against a wall or even clip through some larger enemies you can’t move away from. In such a punishing game where every hit counts, it can be very frustrating. Performance issues are still not fixed on PS5, the game cannot run at 60FPS. Given it’s not exactly a very advanced game graphically, it’s baffling this can’t keep a consistent 60FPS. I love the world and art style but the visual fidelity is just not at the standard of other next gen titles. An excellent game, certainly very different and breaks the traditional mould for open world games but the balance is not right for me. A fantastic game that has potential to shift how other devs look at open world games which is great, but I can’t give this a 10/10 when there are clearly issues in multiple areas. But it comes close to a perfect 10, what an incredible game, I have 100 hours at the time of writing and anticipate a few hundred more.",9,2022-12-08,PLAYSTATION 5

epic_gamerdude,"I dont Understand Why All these Reviews In elden ring Describing How theres ""No Story or Lack There of"" You need to Play the game to Enjoy the story, Reading Item Descriptions And Killing bosses And watching cutscenes, Im not Saying you have to De-vote Your entire Life to this game. Its a Good game admittedly And it's okay To Ask for help from other players. There is a Reason this game Has Co-op Theres a Reason it Has Difficult Gameplay and No Questlogs Or difficulty Options, Because that is its identity. If you Remove The difficulty Of dark souls and add An easy mode, Or add A questlog And Constant dialogue, You ruin this game. Its okay to not enjoy Elden ring But it's not okay when You start Critiquing Parts of games when You dont understand why its there. What do you get when you Allow Players to Get the game less difficult, You get a shallow experience. What was Skyrim? A shallow RPG with Good adventure Mechanics, That was skyrim. It was a Bad RPG good Open world Game While you may look At it as a Good rpg Skyrim is not, Its a good one if you enjoy more laid back Casual esc Games like Call of duty. This game was made for a more Niche Audience.Anyways enough of my rant and here's the rest of the review Elden ring's story Isnt The greatest but it's not the Worst. The reason you have to comb through the entire Game to learn the story is because Its not meant to be laid put to you on a Silver platter. You're meant to Kill bosses and Venture into dungeons. Its all there for a reason. These aspects are meant to be used to their fullest extent. The story is meant to be Interpreted by You. You can make up whatever you want. Its your Choice because 1. You bought the thing 2. The game's story isnt fully laid out to you so you have to fill in the holes with what you think of. Overall 9/10, Not the second coming Of Christ but it was good. Certainly deserves GOTY",9,2022-12-08,PLAYSTATION 5

Rydberg98,"tl,dr: Elden Ring is a masterpiece with some flaws. However, you are not guaranteed to like it, since Fromsoft sticks to their formula regarding graphics, multiplayer and most important of all difficulty. First, the reason why most review sites (rightfully) acclaim this game: It does not tell you what to do. There is a tutorial of course, but after that you are free to explore the huge open world with only a loose suggestion where to go. This game does NOT bombard you with markers on the map or characters who spoon-feed you the story and solutions for your in-game problems. And this is what really is the selling point of this game: When you find something interesting, when you beat an enemy or when you connect lore pieces to a coherent story, it is all your doing and gratification comes with it. And there are many interesting things to find from loot, bosses to npcs and side quests. Some bosses are a bit repetitive, but since the scope of this game is larger than anything they did until today, it is excusable. Regarding the difficulty: This game is a Soulslike. That means you will die a lot and most bosses and even enemies will impose a challenge for players unfamiliar with the genre. If that is not of your liking, look elsewhere. A changeable difficulty setting, or an overall easier game will not happen, should not happen if you ask the Fromsoft fanbase and is comparable to asking for guns in FIFA or a PEGI 3 rating for GTA. Therefore, every soulsborne fan is probably satisfied with the challenge Elden Ring poses. Nonetheless, there are plenty of mechanics to get help from: spirit ashes which will attract boss attention or other players who can help in multiplayers. The most difficult bosses are also optional. Even players new to the genre should give it a try. For a game with great difficulty, it is of utmost importance that the internal mechanic is good enough that you are actually fighting the bosses and not the controls. And the game mechanics guarantee just that. Controls are understandable, animations smooth and you have plenty of possibilities to adapt the fighting to your personal style and even be able to change your stats and weapons mid-game. The wide range of weapons, spells, and talismans are interesting and allow several approaches to tackle an enemy. The lore is fascinating, and you should definitely read item descriptions and listen to npcs to understand what is going on. Their stories are often catching, and the underlying (interpretable) bigger picture is worth the effort. Personally, I think other Fromsoft games have a better underlying lore where they tackle more interesting questions, although none of them has a lore so rich. Elden Ring is more defined by the relations of the fractions and gods among themselves than the question of humanities place in the world. The graphics are not AAA standard compared to games like God of War, Horizon or even the Demon’s Souls remake. Do not get me wrong, the design of Elden Ring is great and connects very well to the overall lore/story. So well, that you can hunt for details in boss design and likely be able to learn something from it. But the technical aspects are an average B-. Clipping errors, loading of objects and washed-out textures are common. As I mentioned, this isn’t a surprise, and the game is definitely an improvement compared to Dark Souls, but it is something they should work on. There focus is clearly on game mechanics and design. I do think this game is beautiful, but in 2022 more is possible. At last, the multiplayer is fun for cooperation and invasion of players. But the whole mechanic is still tedious to understand and to execute, since areas are often randomly defined as a section which you can’t leave while in coop or invasion. Sometimes this is necessary, sometimes it is just annoying. But still Elden Ring does it way better than Bloodborne. Summary: Elden Ring has everything a soulslike fan could want, but still suffers from similar problems other Fromsoft titles did. However, the vast open world, interesting lore, challenging bosses with intelligent design and the thrill of exploration outweigh all the quirks by a great margin. GOTY incoming, 10/10 Fromsoft game.",10,2022-12-06,PLAYSTATION 5

yusukeraz,"There were so many awe moments. The exploration is huge and it's like I'm writing my own story. The combat has so many ways to tackle all the enemies. Weapons, summons, Co op and character creation have vast options. The game is so much fun, the story is top tier cuz I'm also crafting it as I progress and get stronger. The freedom to do what you want and how to do things is a great feeling. The epic boss battles, surprises at every corner and the difficulty of every challenge and when you clear it. It feels so rewarding. Elden ring is amazing! I cleared it after 200 hrs. It is very long for those that want to do everything but it is up to the player how long they want to take to finish the game and of you don't. Then that's where it ends. You die and become a tarnished that failed. Like the npc that went hollow in dark souls. They became a hollow and gave in to it, roaming the land in a madness state. So in a way. That was your story. You failed to become elden lord.",5,2022-12-06,PLAYSTATION 5

Glaeder,"""Potential realized but with some recycling."" World: Elden Ring takes book straight out of The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild with a very content rich open world that rewards players for exploring every nook and cranny the environments have to offer. I rarely found a section of the world that did not have some sort of secret or item within it's vicinity. Every scale and section have been crafted to encourage the players curiosity. Combat Everything you can expect from the souls formula and more! There are so many weapons, items, armor, consumables, summons, magic, enchantments that contribute to an almost endless level of combat customization that it at times can be overwhelming. However, the game is still as rewarding even with a simple sword and shield combo. Punishing yet rewarding is still present in the combat system. Story Just like every bother souls game, uncovering the mystery about the world you are dropped into and learning more about the inhabitants are still a strong staple in this game. You are going to still have to work hard to learn more about the lore and history of Elden Ring so be prepared. Recycling Almost every aspect of the game is perfect however, due to the size and scale of the game Fromsoft clearly had to reuse a lot of the same sub-bosses/bosses for many of the open world encounters. This is no fault by them but by the end of the game I found myself getting tired of seeing the same floating cat boss over and over again. In closing, Elden Ring makes a great lol ""Beginner Friendly"" entry to those looking into to finally making the leap into a souls like game. The difficulty is still very much as punishing as expected from a souls game however, the addition of spectral summons and the massive amount of weapons and magic you can learn provide ways for players to help level the field just a tiny bit.",8,2022-12-05,PLAYSTATION 5
GaymerRobz,"I fell for the hype but honestly.. the exploration of the world is fun but models look samey very quickly and character customisation in terms of the way you look is not expansive so I felt like an npc very quickly.

On the other hand, the best thing about this game is that it brings different perspective to open world design which makes you feel completelty free to do anything in an incredible fantasy world.

Kingcaleb234,"This game is definitely awesome, but has many flaws that ruin it. The boss fights are next level, the soundtrack is incredible, and the art style/ atmosphere really is a sight to behold. Even though these things are great there are tons of issues. The content in the world is copy pasted with not that much liveliness to it, (excluding the occasional dungeon in regards to copy and pasted). The world just feels dead overall. The issues with the framerate on the current gen consoles is also frustrating. As for mechanics of the game there is nothing that makes it feel like it has been perfected or gotten better in any way. The combat and movement is still pretty clunky and janky. The tutorials are not helpful enough especially for players who are newcomers to the ""Souls"" type series. The menu and crafting system, and item use can be confusing as far as what the items do and what the purpose is. Compared to Sekiro's combat it feels like it is missing something. Also, sadly a lot of the same combat animations are used from Dark Souls 3. It just feels like the 10/10 ratings are all hype. I would say it is more likely in the 6/10 - 7/10 range. Although, that is just my opinion. The game just feels the exact same as all of the older FromSoftware titles including the older ones. If it is not broke don't fix it I guess, but there needs to be exciting new features and mechanics added.",7,2022-11-29,PLAYSTATION 5

justnotfalling,"Lmao, butthurt over criticism this game receives, is absolute next level sht. No surprise tho, this is the first time ever, when real actual gamers tried to play ""Souls"" game. Because it was marketed as ""easier to get into than other souls titles"". Everyone knows that souls fanboys hardly ever play actually good stuff like final fantasy 7, red dead 1/2, gta games and so on. It's also first time ever lots of souls players experience open world setting. Not making it up even, there's so many comments on youtube about the fact that these people usually hate open world games. So now, when all the other gamers were invited to the party and they experienced how badly designed these boss simulators really are, of course they are angry. They should be. Actually good stuff almost never receives metascore 96. That's unheard of. For people who have played open world games their entire life, elden ring is one of the emptiest and most boring open world games they have ever seen. Of course they say it's sht, because it is sht.

Downgrade in every aspect possible and what do they get? Highest Metascore. I wouldn't be surprised, if this was literal attempt by journalists (who don't like games or gamers anyway), to destroy gaming as a medium. They choose one of the most outdated, boring and empty games and hyped it up as a ""masterpiece"". If this is the blueprint how future games are supposed to be (no story, no characters, no meaning, no nothing, just pointless very hard combat), if that's the future of video games, then it's literally over. And that's exactly what these journalists want. They don't want players to have meaningful stories and characters that would empower them, no. They want the opposite.

The open world and ""questing system"" are the new benchmark for the entire genre. For me it's one of the best games I've ever played.",10,2022-11-23,PLAYSTATION 5
AnAngryGamer,"This game is essentially a boring and repetitive version of Dark Souls with some changes to item names. I bought this as I did actually like Dark Souls 3, but Elden Ring just feels and runs like crappy PS3 game, seriously, my PS5 couldn’t even manage a stable 120FPS, at that stage, I returned it and bought another copy of Dark Souls 3. Another aspect I hate is the easiness, for the love of god, the only reason I remotely enjoy this is for the challenge, and when I have ghosts essentially fighting for me, it’s no good. The art design is only sometimes nice, other than that it feels like a muddy, brown world with a thin line of paint. I cannot even believe how some people think this might even have a slim chance of winning Game Of The Year, truly a terrible year for gaming as a whole.",0,2022-11-23,PLAYSTATION 5
Timsen375,"Vorab möchte ich sagen, dass ich Elden Ring nicht schlecht finde. Wenn ich aber ehrlich zu mir selbst bin, ist das für mich die Enttäuschung des Jahres und ich würde am liebsten weniger Punkte vergeben. Objektiv betrachtet macht das Spiel aber auch einige Sachen richtig und das möchte ich nicht zu extrem bestrafen. Ich würde, trotz das ich großer Fan von Bloodborne, Ds3 oder Sekiro bin nicht sagen, dass meine Erwartungen zu hoch waren. Ich habe mich zwar grundsätzlich auf den Titel gefreut, wirklich gehyped war ich nicht. Ja, Eldenring bringt ähnlich wie Zelda BotW oder Ghost of Tushima einen frischen Wind in das Open World Gerne. Jedoch ist man hier irgendwo auch über das Ziel hinausgeschossen. Ingesamt stören mich 6 Themen sehr. 1. Die Open World selbst: So toll der Ansatz der Freien Wahl und Erkundung ist, sie ist lange nicht so gut gemacht wie es oft dargestellt wird. Die ganze Welt macht einen trüben und leblosen Eindruck, nicht zuletzt wegen der schlechten Technik. Die Welt soll ja verlassen und trostlos sein, aber sie fühlt sich trotzdem nicht lebendig an. Zelda BotW hat dieses Problem deutlich besser gelöst. Da waren auch nur ganz wenige NPCs über die Welt verstreut und einige große Städte, trotzdem war ein großer Teil der Welt leer, sie hat sich aber nie so angefühlt. Zum großen Teil ist hier auch das Sounddesign bei Zelda dafür verantwortlich, dass nie solch ein negatives Gefühl zustande kommt (und nein ich meine nicht die Musik). Alles in Elden Ring fühlt sich tot an. Hinzukommt, dass ich mir immer mega umständlich einen Weg suchen muss, anders als bei Zelda. Wenn ich in Zelda einen interessanten Ort sehe, kann ich da einfach hin und durch einige Tricks dir Ausdauer beim klettern regenerieren. Dadurch fühlt sich diese Freiheit gar nicht so frei an. 2. Die Seelenasche: Die Darksouls Reihe hat einem immer wunderbar beigebracht am Ball zu bleiben und die Mechaniken und die Gegner zu studieren. Man wusste immer wenn man gestorben ist, dass man selber dafür verantwortlich ist. Die Seelenasche nimmt das aber zum großen Teil. Außer der Mana Anzeige gibt es kein Limit durch andere Attribute, weshalb das für mich eine zusätzliche Mechanik ist. Eine Mechanik die aber dafür sorgt, dass wen ich bei einem Boss sterbe das Gefühl habe, nicht effektiv genug gekämpft zu haben. Ja irgendwo ist es eigenes Versagen, aber zum anderen schwingt immer das Gefühl mit, nicht optimal gekämpft zu haben. Man muss es nicht einsetzten, aber die Hemmschwelle ist auch sehr gering sich doch mal Hilfe zu holen. 3. Die besten Momente sind nicht in der Open World selbst: Am stärksten ist für mich Eldenring immer dann, wenn man in die größeren Dungens kommt. Hier kommt für mich die volle Stärke zum Vorschein, die Darksouls schon immer ausgemacht hat. Diese Dichte beklemmende Atmosphäre ist eine Riesen Stärke der Serie und durch die Open World kommen viel längere leere Phasen dazwischen, in denen gar nicht so viel passiert. Ja hier und da gibt es was nettes zu sehen, aber das ist zum einen nur selten belohnend, je nachdem welchen Spiele Style man priorisieren, zum anderen aber auch nicht sehr spannend gemacht. Ja es gibt Highlights, aber zu selten. 4. Der fehlende Fokus: Ich hatte zwei mal die Situation wirklich nicht mehr voran zu kommen. Das Spiel gibt einem manchmal so wenig Anhaltspunkte, wo es den jetzt wirklich weiter geht, dass man ewig lange in der Open World am suchen ist. Das ist vor allem dann ärgerlich, wenn man ein paar Tage nicht spielen konnte. Spätestens dann geht das Konzept nicht mehr auf und man muss googeln und das frustriert. Auch das hat Zelda besser gelöst, indem die wichtigsten Punkte markiert sind und der Rest man einfach irgendwie machen sollte. Zelda war hier zwar nicht ganz so frei, dafür deutlich fokussierter und auch irgendwo logischer. 5. Die Bosse: es gibt ein paar außergewöhnliche und sehr gute Bosse, dass kann und will ich nicht absprechen. Jedoch gibt es auch einen Haufen nicht so guter Bosse, die sich auch gerne wiederholen. Gerade bei den größeren Bossen ist die Kammera eine Katastrophe (Feuerriese) und machen deshalb auch nicht so viel Spaß. Vorherige FromSoftware Titel haben das alles deutlich besser hinbekommen. Hier sehe ich echt einen Rückschritt. 6. Die Technik: Ich habe hier definitiv kein Grafikwunder erwartet, aber wie manchmal die Texturen nachladen müssen ist einfach nur schlecht. Es kommt zu keinem Zeitpunkt ein Next Gen Gefühl auf. Fazit: Ich kann mir die teils hohen Wertungen nur so erklären, dass viele Leute wirklich keine guten Erfahrungen mit der Open World der letzten Jahre gemacht haben. Alles was Eldenring ausmacht gibt es in besser. Ghost of Tushima und Telda BotW bleiben meiner Meinung nach deutlich besser, selbst wenn solche Sachen wie die Charaktergestalltung eingegrenzter ist.",7,2022-11-23,PLAYSTATION 5

GabrielF0608,"this game is simply GOTY (I hope) what they have done here is simply a MASTERPIECE, but let's break it down 1 - THE MAP: The Elden Ring map is simply something I haven't seen in a while, an open world that WORKS! there is no one guiding you, there is no yellow line guiding you, there is no map in the corner of the screen, ABSOLUTELY NOTHING! The game just throws you into that huge and intuitive world that you don't even know where to start exploring, and when you think you're done there's MORE, everything you see is not just a PNG to give the idea that there's a world, everything it's an area for me to explore, for example when you arrive in liurnia dos lagos you see something that looks like a castle, and you arrive at the castle and think ""ok I'm going to go in and it's going to be quick, never would anyone put so much work into a simple castelinho"" me when you see you're inside raya's academy it would be a huge area with more than 7+ hours of gameplay if you're going to explore everything 2 - THE BOSSES: kinda repetitive and few are memorable, you can understand because it's a huge game, but you could at least work on some models maybe 3 - THE COMBAT: like dark souls with some modifications you can put special attacks on weapons and there are some different movements 4 - GRAPHICS: it doesn't matter that much, after all, a game is not made of graphics BUT OH MY GOD EVERY PLACE I LOOK IN THIS GAME IS A PICTURE 5 - ONLINE: good for invoking help, but for pvp it's not that good 6 - PLATFORMS: I played on PlayStation 4 and then on PlayStation 5 when I bought it and ok, but before launch I had bought it for PC and... I don't know how it is today but at that time it was very poorly optimized 7 - HISTORY: I'm too lazy to research it but it doesn't matter much 8 - SHOULD YOU BUY?: Absolutely! it's so worth it, 221 hours I spent of my life, could I have spent it on something good for me? yes, but still... i have no regrets, thank you FROMSOFTWARE and hope this wins GOTY",10,2022-11-21,PLAYSTATION 5

srijansin91,It's difficult to put into words how satisfying the gameplay and polish of this game is but it's truly a crowning jewel of From Software's incredible efforts in the last few years.

SirSabza,"What can i say that already hasn't been said? An 8 is high for me, i rarely give 9s and 10 is an impossible rating that all games should strive for. No game is perfect so no game should get a perfect score. Elden ring is incredible, a great game for new and old players in the Genre. It's enough different whilst still feeling the same. But its sadly a game plagued with all the issues of open world and a poor launch for performance and some issues with online balance. Elden ring is one of the best designed open worlds i've ever seen, you could literally put a 2 minute stop watch on repeat and before the timer stops you'd fine something interesting in the world every single time. It's designed that way, a place of interest spread so every 1-2 minutes the player is distracted by something new. it's the most accessible Fromsoft game to date, if you use the tools the game gives you, its by far the easiest game we've had (aside from 1-2 bosses being over tuned for this exact reason) which is great for new players, and if you want the brutal challenge this genre has become famous for, you can adjust the difficulty by just not using spirit ashes or co-op play. It's weapon design is great and so is its enemy design. Sadly however, the game suffers from overuse of assets due to it being an open world game. It also had a really bad launch with crashing and low frame rates.",9,2022-11-21,PLAYSTATION 5
Jackward1,"(First of all, I have never played any souls game before Elden ring came out, so my opinions are probably not as reliable as others.) I think that this game is a good game, but it's just repetitive a lot of the time. When I bought this game I was expecting to have a massive world that I could explore and go anywhere that I want. The world is big, but you can not explore it easily, and many areas are restricted. In my opinion, I think being able to just go anywhere on the map easily would benefit this game, similar to Zelda. On a positive note, I do think that the gameplay and difficulty are perfect, despite how hard it is. I do think this game definitely has its moments, especially when you are fighting a boss. This game probably has the most variety in terms of enemies and biomes, but a lot of the biomes are just bland and ugly. Another complaint I have is that the weapon/armor system is horrible. There is just way too many weapons that it becomes incredibly overwhelming to choose a good one that fits you. If someone were to ask me if they should buy Elden Ring, I would tell them that it really depends on the type of games that you like to play.",5,2022-11-20,PLAYSTATION 5
MadMix,"История и сюжет. Наверно это самый слабый, скучный и неинтересный лор из всех soulslike игр FromSoftware… Мотивация и заинтересованность крайне слабые, чтобы двигаться вперед. Персонажи. Каждый npc прописан грамотно и добротно, в чем разработчики преуспели еще в предыдущих играх. Однако наш персонаж (со времен Demon’s Souls) - безликая тень без голоса, эмоций и характера. Мир и локации. Вы будете под впечатлением первые 60 часов игры. Локации пустые и растянутые, из-за чего все напоминает театр с декорациями. Разработчики постарались взять механику Dark Souls и натянуть на открытый мир, из-за чего что-то работает хорошо а что-то плохо. Подземелья - кроме как ctrl+c и ctrl+v я не могу объяснить их количество и качество. Многие локации для прыжков заточены под Sekiro, где механика более интересная. Тут персонаж прыгает неуклюже, лошадь неповоротлива и неудобна. Враги привязаны к своим локациям. Некоторые мини-боссы просто телепортируются домой, полностью восстановив свое здоровье. Если это и есть нововведение, то оно устарело на 5-10 лет. Боссы. Чтобы сосчитать действительно хороших боссов, хватит пальцев одной руки. Самое худшее, это взять обычного солдата/гаргулью/голема и нарисовать им полоску ХП. Подобных псевдо-боссов мы встречаем десятки раз за одно прохождение, отличающихся от своих копий только цветом, броней и оружием, с одной и той же анимацией. Графика. Привет Bloodborne, Dark Souls 3 и Sekiro. За 6 лет ничего не поменялось. Если эта графика выглядела сносно в 2015 и 2016, терпимо в 2019, то в 2022 это уже старье. Квесты. Их стало больше и это главный плюс, но в остальном это чистая механика из Dark Souls. Квесты разных персонажей переплетаются или идут по одиночным линиям, и стоит тебе не побывать в каком-то месте, не поговорить с одним персом, спустя 20 часов унылых подземелий и 5 копий одного босса, ты натыкаешься на его труп. Почему, зачем, как? Вы не получите ответов в Elden Ring как и в любой другой игре по душам. Ключевые предметы. В прошлых играх уделялось больше внимания мелочам - осколок титанита, мерцающий титанит, титанитовая чешуя и т. д. их невозможно спутать. А что у нас теперь? Кузнечный камень 1,2,3,4,5. Кузнечный камень мрака 1,2,3… Серьезно? Когда в Dark Souls 3 мы находим чей-то пепел, мы можем прочитать про его владельца, в Elden Ring у нас колокольные сферы, в которых ни единого слова про личность. Это даже не один, а два шага назад после серии душ. Итоги. Если полностью закрыть глаза на прошлые части, то Elden Ring покажется увлекательной, разнообразной в игровых механиках и щедрой на приключения. Если вы истинный ценитель темных душ, то вы найдете множество минусов, заимствований и само повторов, завернутых в красивый фантик.",4,2022-11-20,PLAYSTATION 5

And when you find NPCs, the dialogue is pretty sparse. Battle is ridiculously difficult -- with a keep dodging until opening, attack, then go back to dodging model. I kept searching for alternative, less tedious ways to battle bosses, but came up short. Some of the artwork also seems off. Beautiful terrain, but then some screens seem like they were drawn by a child. A lot of the weapons (e.g., katanas) are ridiculously oversized, which creates a disproportionate effect.",4,2022-11-19,PLAYSTATION 5

diogomatsumoto,"This was my first Souls game so I needed to play a good amount of hours to understand most of the mechanics and how the game works... In the beginning I was very frustrated for some reasons, I just wanna play but I needed to create my character... For one side I really appreciate the amount of things you can do to edit your character but it's so complicated that I just skipped even not liking the standard ones. I later found out that you can't barely see him in your playthrough... The graphics aren't what I was expecting, especially for your character and NPCs and the lack of lip sync make it worst. The landscapes are good but I didn't feel impacted by them as I feel I should. For a PS5 game I was expecting another level in graphics and environment. One of the worst things about this game is the story driven or the lack of it.... I almost finished the game and don't know what I'm doing and why I'm doing. NPCs are randomly in the map and you can miss them very easy if you don't explore. The exploration part of the game is the best thing about this game along with the amount of weapons, spells and incantations you can use. The dungeons are fun but can be very similar though. Talking about the combat system, I feel like it's very frustrating at some times since you are punished for pressing a button in the wrong time and the inputs can have a delay to be executed or not to be executed at all... Enemies can hit you though walls... You'll be hit in the back by an enemy that has no sound... Also the lock system can be a pain for large enemies. You need to manage the equipment you carry as it can impact the speed of dodging and your attributes are important as well, mechanics that can be advanced for casual players. I got a lot of frame drops during my playthrough... even 7 months after it's release not all bugs and issues were fixed. Elden Ring is a good game at the end of the day but it's not for everyone. It's a evolution for the Souls games but nothing revolutionary for the game industry.

morgothloux,"Cuando Miyazaki llamó a elden ring ""la evolucion de dark souls"" no estaba exagerando, mu aparte del magnifico arte, el solo hecho de introducir un souls like a un mundo abierto era algo impensable, como lo manejarían, lo manejaron dando una libertad unica, y con un monton de recompensas que hacen de la exploración un deleite. y eso es solo la punta del iceberg. ademas de tener el adn souls, Elden ring nos ofrece muchos acertijos y verticalidad, puzzles opcionales muy originales como las torres a lo largo de las tierras intermedias, sin romper el ritmo del juego, la verticalidad en los anteriores juegos se hace prsente en las mazmorras grandes como el castillo velotormentoso o raya lucaria, a pesar de que el juego es horizontal. con respecto al arte pienso que es de sus puntos fuertes a comparacion de sus demas juegos y los demás. el haligtree de miquella, farum azula, te dan maravillas de paisajes en los que te cuentan una historia, ademas de que se aprecia de diferente forma con respecto a los cambios de tiempo que alternan entre dia y noche. ni siquiera se sienten vacios, y la posicion de los enemigos es perfecta, es como una jungla, no sabes que te va a caer desde las alturas o detras del arbusto. El volumen de las estructuras te hacen sentir abrumado. y la historia, siento que es el punto fuerte del juego, está escrito de tal manera que no deja tantos agujeros a nivel de cada personaje, ademas de entrelazarse entre ellos. me gusta mucho la mitologia original basandose en muchas mitologias, como la nordica que es la principal fuente de inspiracion, tambien vemos mucha de cristianismo, mitologia griega, y celta. y como faltar la inspiracion de berserk que en este juego, se hace mas presente que en los anteriores. en otras palabras elden ring es un juego completo. que te brinda un mundo fantastico y rico en todo los aspectos que debe tener un videojuego. Merece ser el juego del año",10,2022-11-16,PLAYSTATION 5

Dhibbsey,"Elden ring is a beautiful game graphically. I bought it when it first launched due to so many people telling me how awesome it was. Never got around to playing it until more recently. Although visuals were great and sound was pretty good, I wish there were more story elements that i didn't have to go out of my way to understand. I don't want non stop cut scenes, but a few more would've been nice. It should be fun to go through a story, not boring work. I am a father, and finding time to play games is hard. I know souls style games are hard, but I just cant pick it up and progress much with its difficulty. I have played bloodborne and dark souls and i felt similar. It feels like the same games in an open world. I spent about 15 hours with the game. I will say it is definitely good graphically, but just not the game i was looking for. I became bored with dying repeatedly and by the time i would figure something out, itd be time to stop playing. I felt no satisfaction. I had no performance issues, and i don't have hate for the game. But to me, its just not good and i do not understand the hype. Id never give a game a 0 because that's just ridiculous, but i cant give it more than a 3 because its just not fun or entertaining to me. The 15 hours I spent with it were boring and annoying.",3,2022-11-14,PLAYSTATION 5

CPFantastic,"The game is mediocre and mainstream media outlets once again proved that they are irrelevant and trash. One of the things that Sekiro did the best for souls games was adding posture and finishers which made the bosses 10 times more epic than Dark Souls and Bloodborne. Now all of a sudden they just scrapped that and downgraded it to the first souls game. You kill those mediocre bosses and they just vanish that's it, nothing special. Yea there's some kind of a posture still in Elden Ring but it's nowhere near as good. Another thing is the fantastic storytelling which Sekiro had and all of a sudden they felt that they need to not make a story and give us text as a lore. You should sit on your chair and read text... uninteresting af. Yea there's some cutscenes here and there but again, it's not nowhere near as good as Sekiro. Graphics and animations are PS3 or mid PS4 level, even Bloodborne which is a 2015 game has better graphics than Elden Ring 2022. Uninspiring map, level design and bosses which are the same as previous FromSoftware games with no innovation and improvements, basically more the same. They just milking the formula. Mediocrity on every bit of the game.",7,2022-11-14,PLAYSTATION 5

AncianoAgresibo,"Elden Ring es el resultado de más de una década de trabajo de parte del equipo de Fromsofware, puliendo las mecánicas y el gameplay hasta un punto en el que roza la perfección. No sólo es un juego del estilo Souls extraordinario, con batallas y enemigos memorables, complicados y , sobre todo, con un lore muy elaborado y extenso detrás, si no que también ha incorporado de forma fluida el concepto de ""mundo abierto"" , cosa que tiene mucho mérito al ser el primer juego del estilo que desarrolla esta empresa. He leído muchas críticas acerca del rendimiento en PC, pero, por lo menos yo, creo que no importa que haya alguna que otra bajada de FPS's cuando las cosas cargan, teniendo en cuenta que si no utilizamos el viaje rápido hay muy escasas pantallas de carga. Aprovecho para recalcar lo bien optimizado que está el juego para PS4/PS5, nunca me ha dado un tirón (salvo en cierta zona del mapa) y los gráficos también son bastante buenos. Pasando a otra cosa, la ""dificultad"" de la que muchos jugadores casuales se quejan, y de la que estoy bastante seguro será la causa de que Elden Ring no gane el GOTY (Aclaro que estos premios no pueden tomarse en serio después del robo de rdr2), no es alta, y puede ser incluso disminuida todavía más usando diversos ""cheeses"" o elementos desbalanceados como la lágrima mimética, RoB, Cometa Azur... o ""Burn O, flame"" contra Malenia, por ejemplo. Últimamente está siendo comparado duramente con God of War: Ragnarök, cuyos fanáticos más radicales desacreditan el mérito que tiene este juego (Hay que admitir que GoW 5 es un juegazo aunque a mí no me entretenga demasiado), habiendo sido creado por una empresa mucho más pequeña que Sony (Que cuenta con unos 100.000 trabajadores) y aún así haciendo competencia de esta manera. No me queda nada más que agregar, solo espero que Elden Ring sea valorado como lo merece (sin recibir tanto odio de los mencionados anteriormente) y que agreguen más contenido que podamos disfrutar, y volver a criticar, los que verdaderamente pudimos pasar de Velo Tormentoso ;).",10,2022-11-14,PLAYSTATION 5

Some bosses in the early game are way to hard and they get repetitive after time. Combat is great but if you skill on 1 weapon it will get boring after time.

Sohelanthropus,"As a true Souls fan (all Platinums and an abid PvPer and invader since DeS), ELDEN RING is a great game that has very fun gameplay, exploration (if on first playthrough), great soundtrack and overall good and serious ""vibes"" (the game takes itself seriously and it has a soul). But, it holds your hand too much with stuff like tutorials, Ashen Summons, OP weapons and spells, no solo host invasions, stance breaking, not many dangerous enemies. It also is very easy to overlevel an area, because the game does a very poor job gating and placing weapon upgrade materials and Rune gains all throughout the game's areas; making it so, for example, you reach to the Academy of Raya Lucaria at lvl 65-70 (if you've done some decent exploring) when that area feels balanced around lvl 53-60. Overall, I firmly believe From Software casualized the game too much and we the fans didn't gatekeep enough to counteract that. And yet, it still is on one of the best games ever made and the best to come out in these past 2 years, because the game HAS a soul, it has charm and you can feel it was made with love and respect, something most games lack nowadays. I give it an 8, to me a 10 would be the likes of true masterpieces that didn't give a **** about others and they succeeded in doing so, aka Bloodborne, Metal Gear Solid 3, Halo 3 and dark Souls 2 SoFTS.

It encourages you to think about your own path like Skyrim or The Witcher 3, but still retains the style and soul of a typical From Software Souls-like title. Add to that great characters created with great attention to detail and an interesting story with many secrets to uncover. The only thing I would have to complain about is the graphics.

Eduarzinho2305,"O jogo como um todo está longe de ser ruim, mas infelizmente ele é genérico. Inserir Soulslikes dentro de um mundo aberto sempre foi algo pedido, porém essa foi a única mudança relevante. O primeiro mapa (Lingrave) é simplesmente perfeito, tudo é bem detalhado lindo, se todas as áreas fossem únicas como ela iríamos ter o jogo do ano, mas aquilo que tornava ela única só foi sendo reutilizada em TODOS os mapas seguintes. O desining dos inimigos, Bosses, as músicas, me parece que tudo foi muito inferior aos apresentados em jogos antepassados da desenvolvedora, além de utilizar as mecânicas de outros jogos de maneira muito inferior (tirando o powerstance do Dark Souls 2, esse sim foi melhorado, mesmo eu achando mais condizente o do 2), agora o stealth e postura do Sekiro poderiam ter sido muito melhores. Mas onde o jogo errou completamente sem sombra de dúvida foi na repetição, TODAS as dungeons são idênticas, raramente uma possui mecânica diferentes e seus mais de 200 Bosses são na verdade 50 repetidos diversas vezes, chegando ao ridículo de até Bosses de suma importância para a lor do mundo serem utilizados como se fossem uma versão criada pela força de StarWars, 2 exemplos são Godrick e Godfrey, respectivamente. Um jogo incrível, mas infelizmente muito superestimado e decepcionante, sou um fã da saga Souls, em especial os games da saga original e sem dúvidas gastar meu dinheiro neste jogo não foi o mais triste, mas sim ter platinado ele só para completar mais um dos meus games, diferentemente de seus antecessores onde eu tive de farmar pactos (mecânica que sinceramente odeio) e não me senti estressado ou com preguiça, já em Elden Ring, me senti realizando uma tarefa de escola. Espero que o próximo jogo da saga seja o que eu havia interpretado a alguns anos quando veio seu anúncio "" Nosso maior projeto, tanto da Fromsoftware, quando da Bandai"" o game que não será ""finalizado"" com algo que nenhum outro Souls fez com tanta força que foram a pressa e falta de criatividade.",7,2022-11-08,PLAYSTATION 5

Lordofmas,"I can't really fathom all these 10/10 scores, i feel like you all played a different game. Like sure the bosses are fun, sure there are some cool loot in this game. Here is the thing though, recycling. Too much and and it's boring, too little and you have a 20 year project. Personally i felt it was too much, same boss in some random dungeon like 3 times, didn't feel rewarding in the least. Main issue is the balancing, you could easily just balance the weapons so that there isn't such big gaps. First playthrough i died on average 60-90 times per boss, because i like short duel-wielding weapons, makes me feel cool. I had no idea that here you cant do that because the bosses are scaled to handle op magic casting ****, which took me a long ass time to figure out because nobody knew anything yet. Playthrough number 2 3 4, im just cruising through the bosses like it's nothing. is it because i ""got gud""? No, it's because i found op **** and scaled hp, because scaling anything else is almost useless. The best strat is getting a good weapon and just getting enough stats to cover the weapons needs and then only level vitality. I leveled from 20-40 in dex just to test this theory on a boss, i went from 350 per hit to 409, rather useless if you ask me. So my issue isn't that it's ""too hard"" or ""too easy"", it's that without knowledge it's too hard, and with knowledge it's so boringly easy that it's hard to concentrate. A lot of people take pride in this difference and say ""it's because i explored so well"" ""i got good"", when that's not the case. Prime example is if you start samurai: basically easy mode, if you go bandit: hard mode. There has never been this much difference between classes at the start. You could always ""out-skill"" the boss with well timed doges in ds3 but here that is less of a factor and your starting gear matters more, which i think is a huge issue. The only thing here is the awesome bosses that carry the whole game, some cool moments at the end after boring, tiresome, and repetitive gameplay, which to be honest made them feel more grand, so i'll give them that. But it's not a masterpiece, not in the slightest. It's too repetitive, very bland scaling system that makes no sense, poorly scaled armor, and an overvalue of the vitality stat. If these where fixed ye then i would agree it's a masterpiece.",7,2022-11-05,PLAYSTATION 5

Aqualonuss,"„Hervorragendes Open-World Design kombiniert mit perfektem Kampfsystem.“ Ich bezweifle, dass ihr euch überhaupt vorstellen könnt… wie fantastisch Elden Ring ist. From Software hat ein weiteres Mal bewiesen was für Meister des Gamedesigns sie sind. Mit einher geht die fantastisch designte Open World, in der nicht, wie in einem Assassins Creed, jede einzelner Turm durch die Überladung in der Versenkung verschwindet, sonder clever platziert wurde. Ein Breath of the Wild vergleich ist also gar nicht so abwegig. Das Kampfsystem ist stark an die Kämpfe in Dark Souls 3 angelehnt, wobei die Bosse nun gefühlt jede Attacke verzögern können. Auch der Kampf zu Pferd funktioniert besser als von mir zuerst befürchtet. Sturmwind oder Torrent ist auch ein nützlicher Begleiter, der dir mit seinem nützlichen Doppelsprung, dem Beflecktem durch die Open World hilft. Der Soundtrack ist wie gewohnt schön und untermalt nun auch, abseits von den Bosskämpfen, die malerischen offenen Areale, die gefühlt immer schöner werden je weiter man im Spiel fortschreitet. Eins steht fest. Elden Ring ist riesig. Gut riesig. Vollgestopft mit riesigen Überraschungen die einem jedes Mal die Kinnlade herunterfallen lassen. Eine Geschichte ist nicht wirklich vorhanden und obwohl mehr direkt erzählt wird, als nur durch Item-Beschreibungen, versteht man nicht wirklich viel von der Lore ohne sich ausgiebig mit dem Spiel zu beschäftigen. Falls euch der Schwierigkeitsgrad in den alten Souls-Spielen zu hoch war, könnt ihr euch durch die Aschen-Beschwörungen und dem Nutzen von Magie, das Spiel wesentlich leichter machen, was das Spiel zum einsteigerfreundlichsten FromSoftware-Spiel macht. Aber Elden Ring ist nicht frei von Mängeln. Es kommt hin und wieder zu FPS-Einbrüchen oder Texturen und Modelle laden oft zu spät nach. Auch ein paar wirklich schlechte Bosse haben es in das Spiel geschafft, wobei ich mir wirklich ein wenig mehr Qualität und weniger Quantität gewünscht hätte. Auch die kleinen Dungeons wirken einfach wie aus einem Baukasten, was den Spielspaß nicht trübt, trotzdem ein wenig schade ist. Trotzdem ist Elden Ring das beste Spiel was ich je gespielt habe, und mit 10 Stunden jeden Tag, in der Release-Woche hat mich das Spiel so unfassbar gefesselt und wird dies auch noch für weitere Stunden machen. Bestes Spiel aller Zeiten Praise the Sun, Umbasa oder wie auch immer...",10,2022-11-05,PLAYSTATION 5

SplitMind,"Elden Ring has received much praise and critical acclaim elsewhere, so in my review I'd actually like to tackle some controversies and areas where I took exception to Elden Ring, despite enjoying it for nearly 70 hours. The graphics are the best that the Souls genre has to offer and at present are being added to via patches to make them even more stable. My main gripe with them was the framerate dipping sometimes but this was not often or harsh enough to hinder my enjoyment. Elden Ring on one hand is possibly the most accessible Souls game so far, but on the other hand it could easily be a complete nightmare if it's your first Souls game One or two of the early bosses are clearly designed for you to pass and come back to later when you are stronger, however non-Souls players won't know this and could easily be frustrated. The biggest gripe I have with ER and Souls games in general is that an online guide is an essential if you want to progress without constantly hitting barriers. This is doubly evident in ER where we are advertised an open-world, but in reality you will be crushed quickly if you wander too far off the expected path. The game is more like a series of smaller open areas which then become a huge open world by the end, which isn't really a problem as each area gives you plenty to do and explore. Another issue I take note of in ER in particular is this seems to be the Souls game with the cheapest enemies, bosses in particular. I noticed that when enemies do a combo there always seems to be one or two additional attacks that are less intuitive, as if designed to simply catch you off-guard. Added to this was the fact that I ran the tankiest strength build I could conceive of (without going through complex guides) and many later enemies were doing serious damage still, so it makes me hesitant to play as any other build. This brings me to another issue I had with ER. It's simply too big and too long. When I was on hour 69 and beating the final boss I breathed a sigh of relief rather than satisfaction, glad that it was finally over. This doesn't inspire me to replay the game and amazingly I still didn't complete some additional quests and optional bosses as I'd simply become fatigued of the game by this point, especially as the harder optional bosses such as Melania are simply cheap two-stage bosses. Many fans lord over the quests in Souls games but these are one of my most hated areas of the game. They are obfuscated by design, intentionally not giving you obvious or clear instructions. I find it quite bizarre that Fromsoftware would barricade some of their best content and make it very easy to miss - many quests are time or context specific so you can miss an opportunity to complete them altogether. Again, some fans love this but I'm not one of them and disagree with this design. On that note, I'll also give my two cents on another hot topic - difficulty. I fully believe Souls games should have adjustable difficulty levels. Again it baffles me that Fromsoftware would barricade the game itself away from potential fans, although judging by recent sales they don't need to worry about that as much. I just believe that in general we should identify where barriers exist in games and look at whether they need adjusting, and this is already something From is aware of as they have nerfed some weapons and bosses already. Tied to the quests we also have the overall story. Elden Ring is probably the most coherent of the Souls games I've played in terms of story, but again leaves a lot of it in the backseat in favour of gameplay. This is one thing I am in favour of, as I found that when cut-scenes did happen I was much more interested and engaged. Despite my criticisms above, Elden Ring is in the top-tier of games I have played throughout my life and will likely remain a favourite as it shows exactly how an open-world can be done, throwing a gauntlet in the face of games such as Assassins' Creed and Far Cry. It baffles me that developers look at Elden Ring's success and still insist on their exploitative live services. One final thing I have to say is that I actually regret buying ER day one as there is still a lot of updating and patches being brought out by Fromsoftware, so I would actually recommend waiting a few months or for the inevitable GOTY edition as DLC is sure to follow also. This is one game you cannot afford to miss.",7,2022-11-04,PLAYSTATION 5

iMohmmedH,"Positives The Elden Ring game gives you many choices in designing your character and the way you play the way you want, you may choose a samurai near / medium-range or like a long-range wizard, and while you face the bosses, you will learn from your mistakes and discover solutions yourself, the feeling of winning is very beautiful when defeating strong bosses. The challenges remain in studying the bosses, how to eliminate them, the timing of your strikes and blocking attacks, while you focus on the most important Stamina in combat with blood filling and magic. The developer has excelled in making worlds with many beautiful details and secrets. The game will fascinate you with its many areas and a very wide world, all the way to the end of the game and you are fascinated by this great world and the epic music during the fighting and the calm or frightening also succeeded in creating the atmosphere of fighting and exploration. Character development such as Dark Souls is based on the level and the way you play and the development of potions and their effects with the Golden seed or SACRED TEAR with the addition of the new single-use bottle FLASK OF WONDROUS PHYSICK It adds special features such as summoning magic without draining magic, with the development of normal weapons or Basic Legendary level up your play with normal or special stones. The story and characters may seem mysterious and slight, but they follow an environmental narrative that makes you deduce the events yourself, and with many secrets and side stories you will enjoy discovering the mysteries of the world on your own. Negatives Technical performance issues in the appearance of the world in motion, camera problems with entering turns and shooting - locking and incomplete intelligence of enemies can make the experience unpleasant. The abilities of the new generation were not used, and the game was not good at graphics unlike Damon Souls who used the abilities of this generation! Elden Ring is based on the similarity of the Dark Souls series in some areas of the game and its ideas in the leaders and the story, such as the character that guides you on the way and helps to level up, control or the way you fight. And the battles, as well as Bloodborne's resemblance to some of its elements, may become all-consuming to you. The game world is so big, the player gets lost in the beginning, and there is nothing to guide you in the way except some light that comes from the locations of the Quraish. If you finish the whole game, you will see that there are many bosses that are similar in appearance and fighting style, as well as ordinary monsters, which will repeat in many areas and the change is only in the form. changing! Leader in the name of what you faced five times in the same way! Consider the thing very negative. The caves are the same and the idea is to open the door for the leader. The change is only the rial of the cave, but the same look and the same idea, except for some. The caves are like ghost cave with lighting at the end opening the door",9,2022-11-04,PLAYSTATION 5

Bangsi,"Elden Ring is a brand new game from the developers at FromSoftware. They continue with their soulslike formula but this time in an open world environment. It's hard to explain just how big this game is, but it took me about 100 hours to complete the game (main story + exploration of most of the areas) and I can safely say that I never got bored. Usually when a game has this big of a open world that usually means that I get really bored after a couple hours, because it's not hard to make a huge open world, it is however very hard and impressive to make this big of a open world game that is this sprawling with content throughout. It is incredible how FromSoftware managed to so seamlessly transition their more linear style of gameplay in to this incredible open world. There are many different areas you can explore that are very uniquely designed. This world is absolutely beautiful and so rich with content and lore that it never gets boring. The game doesn't hold your hand throughout the game like more of the modern open world games, if you see an area you can most likely go there, at your own risk of course. When it comes to souls games, the gameplay is of utmost importance, and I can confidently say that the gameplay is very solid. It is very similar to Dark Souls, so if you liked the gameplay from Dark Souls (especially Dark Souls 3) then there isn't much to complain about here. There are so many types of weapons, spells, armors and shields that it can sometimes feel a bit overwhelming but what I did was just stick to one build, but if you like a lot of variety then it can't get much better than this. There are a huge variety of enemies and bosses throughout this game. I thought that pretty much all the main bosses were really great, and a lot of them are just pure spectacle. However with the enemies and bosses also lies my one main issue with this game. I think the damage scaling in this game can sometimes be really bad. Some enemies (not bosses mind you) can have some insane moves that can one shot you, or take huge portion of your health, and it can be pretty frustrating. However the thing that kind of saves this, is that there is pretty much always a checkpoint somewhat nearby, so you don't have to travel immense distances just to return to the area where you died. Not much can be said about the story that isn't a spoiler, but I thought the story was very interesting, though you kind of need to make an effort to try and understand the story. It isn't handfed to you, you need to sometimes read item descriptions or talk to certain NPC's to be able to understand some things. But I think overall the story and lore of this game is very interesting, and I recommend taking a little time to read about it. All of this culminates into one of the best open world experiences I've had in a while. 9.5/10",10,2022-10-26,PLAYSTATION 5

DigitalSchism,"Wall of Text Incoming: Elden Ring is a confusing game for me, because I truly struggled to give it a numerical rating. When I was enjoying the game it was some of the most fun I have had with a game in a while, but when I wasn't enjoying it, I wanted to drop it and never look back. I love the open world crafted here, its stunning to look at and exploring it is one of my favorite things to do. Sneaking into enemy camps, attacking a patrol lead by giants, discovering a cave with treasure to be taken, all fun and part of why I enjoy the game, some people say the game is empty, but I never found that to be the case. I find the bosses to be fair but challenging at least up until the late game when I feel they start to lean towards unfair, but there are plenty of people out there who will disagree with that sentiment. My issues come with the overall plot and progression of sidequests. I'm a longtime souls fan so I expect the story to be shrouded in a veil of mystery to be discovered by digging through item descriptions and what little dialogue there is. However, the story of Elden Ring feels like it barely even makes sense. Why does everyone want to kill me? Why am I immortal but the bosses aren't (when the whole premise is supposedly that no one can die in this world)? All questions you can google and find fans explain with the disclaimer that not even they know for sure. When not even basic questions like these can have an answer I start to lose any attachment to the world, my character, and any NPCs. This makes for a game the gets boring when I have had my fill of the combat. As for the sidequests, it bears noting that souls games have always been obtuse with how they handle them. You could always easily miss a game altering sidequest by simply opening the wrong door in previous games. I could somewhat let this slide in the mostly linear games of the past since that promoted proper exploration of the levels, but in an open world game, expecting players to search every nook and cranny to progress a sidequest before accidently locking themselves out of it by doing some arbitrary task is insane. You essentially cannot play this game without a guide if you actually want to complete any sidequests. It's just an outdated design meant for a different kind of game. Despite all that I still give it an 8 because of how much fun it is when you ignore the story and sidequests. Just wish I could give it a 10",8,2022-10-19,PLAYSTATION 5

gonz480,"This game is a dissapointment. The graphics are not bad but are not impressive either. Many areas and enemies look washed out or faded. The Sound design is OK. The combat controls feel sluggish which is a problem for a largely combat focused game. Some of the enemies and bosses are visually impressive, dragons look and move nice for example, but enemies are largely 1 dimensional 'lone wolf' puppets in regard to their AI and behaviours. They all hit hard, so you don't last long against them but they are not smart or sophisticated so how you deal with them isn't **** can sneak up and backstab many enemis pretty easily, other enemies in the area may notice (often not though), but either way you can just evade others until they lose interest in the 'commotion' and resume their normal movement patterns. The combat doesn't feel engaging, it feels like hack and slash against the weaker enemies and more like exploiting game mechanics and evasion against the strong ones. Most of the difficult enemies can be cheesed. You can often kite faster and larger enemies. Others you can use terrain obstructions against. The bosses can be much more difficult because they can be harder to cheese, are in a confined area, and they use their own (sometimes cheesy) attacks that are hard or imposible to avoid or counter. The game is hard, which is to be expected from this developer, but I would say a large amount of the difficulty comes from being thrown into 'the deep end' without any knowledge or help. None of the main systems (character building, leveling, weapon improvement, crafting, multiplayer options, etc) are explained in detail, meaning you have to resort to outside sources. The game does not do much to engage with you or draw you further into its story or other quests. There is nothing (like even a basic journal) to keep track of various quests, what you have started, what they entail, what was said, discoveries you made, or where you should look next. If you happen to talk to an NPC about a quest, you had better jot down the particulars of what is said because there is no way to review or recall it if you don't remember it later on. The world is huge but is mostly filled with hostiles and not much else. There are very few NPC's and merchants. Given the other lacking areas of the game's design, there is no compelling reason to explore it once novelty has worn off. This game feels more like a grind or a job than an adventure. It really isn't much fun and is more tedium and frustration than wonder, adventure, or enjoyment, especially if you aren't willing to spend substantial amounts of time consulting other sources of knowledge to get good at it. It left me with the feeling of a poorly translated Nintendo game. One where, since the translation is poor, nothing makes sense and you wander around trying various things and the only way you make progress is through trial and error and luck, or you get the game guide. Other difficult games that are great have excellent and responsive controls and give you plenty of knowledge on how to get better. The only thing they don't give you is skill. This game gives you nothing in those regards and doesn't even try to weave a compelling narrative to keep you playing or exploring. Given the numerous good reviews from so many reviewers, I expected much more from this game. I don't understand what they were thinking on this one.",4,2022-10-12,PLAYSTATION 5

70Ravenz,"I love this game for its game design and gameplay. It takes all the best of souls games (exploration, challenging, etc) and it’s a little ugly at times, but I am ok with that. It does look a bit last gen graphics, but I would take this over most other open word games just don’t compare. I have about 50 hours in and only through 2 main bosses and several sub bosses. I keep replaying old areas to find new things and secrets. Avoiding internet walkthroughs and really taking it all in. This is my GOAT. This is why I play video games. I have thousands of PlayStation hours on other games and a thousand Steam games played and this game is hands down my favorite. Update 270+ hours in and definitely GOTY and still likely one of the best games of all time.",10,2022-10-11,PLAYSTATION 5
kylocosplay,"Sin duda Elden Ring es el souls que pedía todo el mundo, un mundo abierto con una barbaridad de quest para hacer, castillos, mazmorras y mucha variedad de bosses para derrotar. No le he puesto un 10 porque hay bosses que se repiten mas de dos veces aunque es normal que lo hagan al ser tan grande el mapa. Para mi va a ser uno de los nominados para el GOTY.",9,2022-10-11,PLAYSTATION 5
nVxx,"To set up the stage - this is my first Soulsborne game, I invested over 220 hours in half a year span from which binge-played the first playthrough in 180 hours and played the game solely in the offline mode. With this said, the reuse of models and animations from older From Software games, naturally, did not bother me, though I concur with the other annoyance on the Internet - clumsy combat, clumsy menus, convoluted story with unsatisfactory ending (more about this later), technical issues, especially on launch. And this is not all - the age-old difficulty-balance issue is not magically solved in Elden Ring, you can get overpowered if you want to. Most of the weapons and spells are useless once you get your hands on some of the stronger ones. Some secondary bosses are recycled... I can go on...nevertheless... Elden Ring is a masterpiece. Breathtakingly beautiful world to explore, where every aspect marvelously comes together. An open world done right. I have to start with world design. The open world is huge in Elden Ring. While nowadays that's a derogatory term, that's not true in this case. Elden Ring, with its enormous size, still manages to feel dense and hand crafted. The world is beautiful, from lavish forests, to volcanic mountains, bloody swamps to dungeons and catacombs and more, it stays breathtakingly beautiful. The designers managed to do an exceptional job in serving this beauty, be it climbing a hill and running into a forest shaken by a wind, or doing a small curve on a narrow mountain path revealing a dazzling city resting on a mountain slope. And all of this is implemented with a convincing dynamic day and night cycle. Screenshots and trailers can't do justice to Elden Ring's beauty, even more so words. This needs to be experienced first-hand, also because you need to spend more time in the game to appreciate it. Whenever you have a high ground, the Lands Between open up in their full glory. Distant mountains, vast forests, cities, fortresses, all of that crowned with the Elden Tree in the middle, together form a fascinating, dangerous, living world. Whatever you see in the distance, can be visited, sometimes with some (significant) effort. And all of this is without any space-continuum shenanigans, an enormously big fortress that offers tens of hours of gameplay inside, with secrets in abundance, looks proportionally big from the outside. I don't want to go much into detail here, not to give up any of the joy of the exploration, but exploring is overly satisfying. And touching again on how hand crafted the game feels, it has a very practical use as well. Playing after a long pause it's very easy to remember every pathway and location, since they are that distinguishable. Quest design worthy of the open world. Elden Ring takes a fresh approach on quests: no checklists, no clear instructions, only some faint direction pointers. Upon your journey you encounter characters who might ask for help or even just share some vague hints during discussion. You might encounter the same character under some other circumstances depending on your prior interactions. This might drive completionists crazy, but also feels very natural. Quests are not boxes on the checklist to tick, but occasional interactions with NPCs who are on their own journeys and you never fully know what they are up to and what significance might they have in your own story. And talking about the story... You can blaze through the game relatively quickly and miss the lion's share of the lore and locations. The game has some cutscenes and they are of a very high quality, involving some amazing boss designs, but even for the main story, most of the information is scattered in casual discussions with NPCs and item descriptions(!), I should admit here, even after platinuming the game, I spent some hours on youtube to grasp the lore and storyline reasonably well, since I haven't put enough effort in analyzing all the hints and putting the pieces together. Gameplay with its merits. The game starts steeply, where fighting a single regular enemy is a challenge, not to mention some mini-bosses that casually roam the Lands Between as a testament to your weakness. Every new location, every new enemy sends the hurt rushing... But slowly, with character progression, you gain confidence as the game becomes more approachable. Yet, even with a fair number of ways of cheesing, Elden Ring, with its single difficulty mode, is still an adequately challenging game, so won't please the seekers of 'interactive storytelling'. In the end. It's dangerous to carelessly recommend the game, as a matter of fact Elden Ring did not please even some seasoned From Software fans, but the best advice here would be, to every gamer out there, just give it a try. You might hate the game, but that'll happen quickly. Or you'll fall in love with it, in which case, you'll be in for one of the most memorable journeys in your gaming life.",10,2022-10-11,PLAYSTATION 5

fallacies,"It kills me inside to give this game an 8. I have been anticipating it since it was announced, it has been an unhealthy obsession. The open world made it way too much of a slog. Traversal is annoying, fall deaths from exploring are tedious, the sheer amount of things trying to kill you at all times when you just want to explore, and your inability to fast travel or even look at the map when enemies are around you (basically always). I really hope fromsoft doesn't make exclusively open world games going forward. A big factor in how much you will like this game comes down to whether or not you like using spirit ashes and/or relying on summons for co-op. The game is clearly balanced for using spirit ashes, so if you use them, the difficulty is pretty manageable (exploration with all the enemies around is still tedious). But some bosses are just plain unfun by how difficult they are without spirit ashes. I for one, am not a huge fan of them. I hate a lot of bosses in this game. I really hate the final boss most of all. On my second playthrough I got all the way to the last boss and never finished the game. THe game starts out really strong, so you're tempted to play again, but then you get to a point where you're like, oh yeah, it's no longer fun after this point, or do I really want to go into that dungeon again? What's the reward for sompleting it again? Is it really worth it. Most of the time it's not because the reward is another spirit ash.",8,2022-10-09,PLAYSTATION 5

Unfortunately, the open world is way too big, in the end I just wanted to get through the game and fight to the end, but there was always more and a new area. Less is sometimes more!

nnevill,"I can't set less than 10 for this game because the amount of everything in game is so huge, so much work has been dome so it's 10/10 for sure. I've bet the game for 114 hours. 114 hours!!!! One hundred and fourteen hours! It's 10 time more than should be :) Or at least 5 times. It's too long, last 20 hours despite it was ending I played just to finish it. Some other drawbacks: repeatable bosses/mini-bosses - about 20-25 hours could be saved without repeatable bosses. The more realistic game name could be ""Dark Souls 4"". It's more like a sequel, not a whole new game. Honestly I think From Software must change(or significantly improve) game engine and change something because difference between Dark Souls 1 and Elden Ring is not that big. It's almost the same game with just different graphics. If FS next game will be made in the same way as Elden Ring I probably miss it because I don't think spending another 100 hours of my life playing the same mechanics will be the good choice. I have several other games in my playlist which I could finish instead of Elden Ring(114h): Stray(6h), Spider Man: Miles Morales (14h), RE: Village(15h), Alan Wake remastered(15h), Outer Worlds (30h), Sinking City (25h), Call of Cthulhu (10h). 7 (Seven) games with difference experience and without repeatable bosses..

adrianompo,"Played it at release on PS5, got the Platinum in one month or so (playing slowly and steadily), but writing my thoughts just now. Elden Ring is a very good game, but not the masterpiece that the mainstream media made it look like. First, the lore. It's the same poor storytelling inherited from the Souls franchise, with very few NPCs and lore based on item descriptions. While this was never a problem with Dark Souls, this time they marketed a lot that partnership with GRRM, so I was expecting the best of the two worlds, and it never happened. It felt like a waste of potential. As an open world game, From did a soiid job but it did not set the bar higher in the genre. In fact, there are quite a few bugs that don't break the gameplay but harm the immersion. On that aspect (immersion), the first 10 hours or so are a huge WOW, but as the ending approaches the experience is already getting dull, with many bosses and sub-bosses repeating themselves needlessly. The final boss, by the way, was the most anti-climax enemy I've seen in a long time. The endgame is weak, there's little reason to go for the NG+. I actually enjoyed the experience overall, but I'd be lying if I said that I'll remember it for a long time. When the credits started rollling I was like ""so, that was it?"". Let's be fair: it's a must play, but still inferior to Sekiro. My problem with Elden Ring is not what it is, but what it could have been.",7,2022-09-29,PLAYSTATION 5

The economics are such that prices for weapons and leveling up rise so fast that you have to spend all your time repetitively defeating the same enemies, just to keep progressing.

The game is beautiful and huge and full of content.

If Metallica was much less popular, you wouldn't hear all that crap about Lars Ulrich. In all From Software games, there are bosses I can't beat, so I quit on them, simple as that.

How could a game with massive environmental clipping and bad balance, somehow get worse? Fromsoft finds a way. Not to mention, the input buffer and lag alone drops it down to a 6. It just does. On top of that, the game is still unbalanced. You cannot have a good time playing the game how you want. Is this an enjoyable experience? Is it well balanced? Can you actually rely on skill to beat it? Is it playable? Are the enemy AI coded well? Do they just turtle and spam attacks and have input reading that seems to be coded by a student fresh out of game school? The answers to all these questions make me second guess myself. Except the last one- The answer to that is yes. I have well over 300 hours in this game.

Rhythminthemind,"I have beaten every souls game prior to this one. I love the series, and I am happy with difficulty. But this game breaks the cardinal rule of the From Software design philosophy up until this point. In any previous game, when you lost, that loss would be fair, and something you could have seen coming, and worked your way around if you had been more tactical. That is the joy of the souls games. Improving. Not just getting stronger, but getting smarter. This game doesn't do that. It simply hates you. There are bosses that are literally invisible unless you have a specific torch from a vendor halfway across the world map. There are bosses that can kill you in a single hit, even if you have maximum health and the heaviest armor the game allows. There are enemies that will swarm you and take turns attacking you so that you are locked in a pattern of stuns from which you can't escape. There are enemies with their backs turned that are programmed to get up and charge you even if you are invisible. Previous games operated on the rule that if you lost, it had to be fair. You had to have done something wrong in order to fail. In this game, you lose simply because of a coin flip. Or because the game was programmed with a pit fall that you had no way to predict. Or even worse, that breaks the pre-established rules the game set up. This game breaks its own rules, and does it just to screw up the player. Elden Ring. Hates you.",0,2022-08-31,PLAYSTATION 5

BrianDavid94,"Quick background on me the reviewer, I tend to like single player games that is heavy on narrative the most. I also play a lot of racing games and use to play multiplayer games in my high school days but now that it's hard for me and my friends to find a good time to link up so now it’s more rare for me to get into a multiplayer game. Up to try any genre of games and sometimes I find something new that I didn't think I'd like. I own a PC (built by me), Xbox One X, Xbox Series X, PS3, PS4, PS5, and a Switch. I prefer Playstation due to their focus on narrative games. For scoring, I’ll be using the Gameinformer review scale and of coursed influenced by my personal opinions. (8)Very Good. Innovative, but perhaps not the right choice for everyone. This score indicates that there are many good things to be had, but arguably so. So I have tried to play Dark Souls Two, and Dark Souls Three but didn't get too far. I would lose interest in the Story because you had to hunt for the information. I did beat Bloodborne though even though you had to hunt for the story in that one too. I enjoyed the combat more in Bloodborne which is probably why I ended up finishing it. I ended up trying Elden Rings since people where saying they were changing up the formula and making it more open and exploratory. I still dislike hunting for the story and I felt like the open world hurt the series more than there previous formula. I enjoyed figuring out a zone and clearing it in the past games and just felt clueless on what I'm suppose to do in this game. I would YouTube it to figure out the story expecting more only to be disappointed. I've learned that this just isn't one of my genre of games. I want to experience a story and not go on a treasure hunt. I see why others like it but it's not for me.",8,2022-08-29,PLAYSTATION 5

fergie716,"These are some of my thoughts as someone who doesn’t play a lot of games. When I first started I really did not like this. I’m a very “casual gamer” who is used to narrative heavy games like RDR2, AC Valhalla, Horizon, etc. I thought “Where’s my quest log? What am I supposed to do? Why is the first boss I face this gigantic sentinel?” It wasn’t until I realized “Hey dummy, just run past the sentinel. Go explore and find out what you’re supposed to do” that I really started to appreciate this game. There’s very little hand holding here. At first I felt this was to the games detriment however after figuring out some of the mechanics and focusing on leveling up my build properly (I was trying to put runes into a little bit of everything at the beginning) I started to appreciate how special this game is. It’s kind of like putting together a puzzle without a reference picture. Yeah it’ll be challenging but give it time, find the corner pieces and start making the boarder. I’m about 35 hours into the game and am not close to being done. However as the game progresses my enjoyment has continued to increase. The games bosses can be tough but fair. And if you can’t beat them right away go and get more runes to level up. From what I have gathered there’s no penalty to holding off on fighting bosses. I’ve had a great time playing Elden Ring. Overall I’d say 9/10 is a fair assessment. It is close to a 10/10 however I do think the developers could have added a journal or log of some kind for all of the little side quests and NPCs you meet. There’s a ton and I found it super easy to forget about quest lines. You can use map markers but NPCs will bounce around the map sometimes. If you struggled at the beginning of this game like me I’d say go back and have another try. Really commit to a specific build. Find a weapon you really like and upgrade it early. If you’re stuck or don’t know where to start seek out the community online! There’s a ton of great resources out there that are designed to help newcomers like us.",9,2022-08-26,PLAYSTATION 5

PeaBeDoo,"I have found the frame rate and graphics perfectly acceptable in this game. The desire to explore this beautifully rendered open world is quite strong. However, it stops there. I know a lot of players truly love the mechanics of figuring out how to defeat a tough boss, and this game will surely hit the mark for them. For me, and those that really enjoy exploring an open world with some tension lingering to make the exploration process more alluring. This game crushes that joy of exploration. Explore a little, encounter a mob that takes a long, repetitive effort to defeat, explore a little more, then spend a long tine trying to defeat the next mob. It saps all the fun and joy out of exploration. I have purchased From After playing this game for awhile, I am revising my score from a 3, to a 10. It took me awhile to get the hang of character development and advancement … but once I did, Elden Ring has quickly become my favorite game of all times.

BobsityJonesity,"Elden Ring might go down as one of the most ambitious games of the decades. Taking the already successful dark souls formula and expanding it to such a large scale was perhaps the riskiest move fromsoft could have attempted, however, it really paid off. Not only is the map about 5 times bigger than anyone imagined, it also is filled with enough content to justify the scale. The combat is taken and slightly refined from the previous fromsoft games, making it smooth and engaging. The bosses in this game rival some of the best from the dark souls 3 and bloodborne dlcs, each with their own unique dynamics and fighting styles. The game starts out so strongly and just continues to improve the farther you get in. There is always something off the beaten path, whether it be a cave or something else, which makes sidetracking and exploring worthwhile. The legacy dungeons as well are finely constructed and flow well with the rest of the open world, providing a nice balance between the two sections. While there are a few complaints to be levied at the game, such as certain bosses being bs or certain sections which just aren't fun, but ultimately these pale in comparison to the quality of the rest of the game. The main problem that I do think is apparent in the game is its lack of replayability. While this isn't a problem for most people since they won't play the game beyond their first time, for those who want to play again they'll likely notice that the game doesn't hold as much magic. This isn't to say it is not great, the legacy dungeons and the bosses are still a lot of fun on repeat runs but the traveling and the side content grows stale the second time around. However, this still in my opinion doesn't take away the fact that fromsoft created perhaps the best open-world game of all time and something which may change the industry for years to come. Elden ring should serve as an example for developers just what they can do if they are passionate about their craft and are dedicated first and foremost to creating an interesting experience for the players",10,2022-08-21,PLAYSTATION 5

Aksal,"First of all Elden Ring was an amazing experience for me it's absoluetely a work of art. My gameplay has took 150 hours and I have finished the game 2 two times and I can say, it was breathtaking firstly I'll talk about gameplay and open world as a open world player I loved this world it provides to gamers a dead world exactly opposite of rdr2. It does not have any dull open world activities or side misions like all ubisoft games. Just rotten and dead open world.Moreover it is surrended by many exciting mysteries also until 70 hours it does not repeat itself. And every mysterious place in this game have a worthy reward at the end. As a result it lures your exploration desire.Another important thing about this game is rpg **** can express yourself in every way for instance if you want to create a paladin of erdtree you can or a ice mage. In my opinion every item in this game has been created very smoothly and cool I spent my 10 hours to find every outfit. Final important point about this game is boss designs and design of open world first of all this game has many bosses some of them is similar but others is designed very marvelous as melenia she is one of the hardest boss in the game and I love her design and splash art if I mention difficulty of bosses. Very few of them is pretty hard others have very understandable patterns and not diffucult to find **** most important thing for me is the world design this game gived me admiration every time ı stepped into another place.First time I went to capital(an area ın game)ı sat down and watched the sight. As a result I took 100 pictures untill the end and every of them is a work of art I loved **** It is time to talk about cons. In my opinion side missions questlines in this game is very hard to solve ı could've never done those if I hadn't searched on youtube. another thing is memorability of bosses let me explain. In sekiro I fought with well designed bosses like second form of owl or the last boss and every of them have left an unforgottable mark on me but elden ring couldnt have done that ( except malenia my love) All in all I recommend this game to every gamer especially who wants to starts souls games.",10,2022-08-15,PLAYSTATION 5

Azzajkd,"Chi critica questo titolo lo fa per difficoltà e ""assenza di storia"", ma la storia c'è eccome, ed è superiore a quella della maggioranza dei videogiochi, semplicemente devi scoprirla, non te la raccontano, devi leggere gli oggetti, e per quanto riguarda la difficoltà, è difficile ma meno di molti, e un tempo tutti i giochi lo erano. Con un minimo di pratica è un gioco che diventa alla portata di tutti, e quando impari non puoi più smettere. Aggiungerei, che nel marasma di open world tutti uguali, enormi e vuoti, con secondarie identiche, stesse meccaniche da Ubisoft ripetute fino al vomito e quant'altro, questo titolo si distingue eccome. Nessun punto della mappa è uguale ad un altro, i nemici hanno tutti un peso nella trama, ogni cosa ha un perché, il design è straordinario sia per mostri che per ambientazione. Unica nota dolente del titolo è il lato tecnico, non è un titolo next gen, ma con un comparto artistico del genere non pesa proprio per nulla. In conclusione, per chi non è avvezzo ai souls questo potrebbe essere un buon punto di partenza, essendo più semplice dei precedenti giochi From, ed avendo un open world ammaliante, per chi invece è avvezzo, questo titolo è un vero parco giochi, una evoluzione straordinaria che la saga meritava!",8,2022-08-13,PLAYSTATION 5

eriatarka,"Elden Ring is an entry in the catalogue of From Software of extremes. I felt immense joy discovering new zones. I felt excitement at new weapons and spells and armor and talismans. I felt disappointment at recycled enemies and dungeons. I felt absolute dread at the forward directions of games they're going to release at many of the boss fights. As such Elden Ring has to have some of the lowest low points of any souls game, even lower than pre-SOFTS DS2. I've played these games since Dark Souls 1, and played every entry, and I'm confident in saying its the worst entry. This comes about not because the game is bad overall, but because where the game is bad it's atrocious. positives of the game: the open world is gorgeous and huge, the ashes of war system is brilliant and adds a great deal of variety, the art direction has never been better only being out by bloodborne in my opinion, the story feels more present and well written, there is a lot of stuff to do, inclusion of duplicating remembrances is convenient, bell bearings are also super convenient, theres more emphasis on elucidating some of the games more opaque features than in previous games negatives of the game: endgame bosses don't feel like they've been playtested, poor balancing of many things like endgame areas, dungeons outside of the legacy dungeons feel very hastily thrown together and cut and paste, horseback mechanics (which were a big part of the marketing) feel like an afterthought that was glued on after most of the game, drop rates are very abysmally low , spirit ashes don't feel like they were well balanced, platforming still feels like an afterthought, graphical performance leaves something to be desired, the tediousness of some side dungeons make them super easy to skip on subsequent playthroughs, there's very little incentive to collect great runes because they offer nothing if you don't use a rune arc (despite the fact that the item description misleads the player into thinking it does), enemy variety plummets significantly after the capital, item crafting seems half thought out and becomes irrelevant late game, many enemies feel like they were designed with sekiro in mind but were just ported into elden ring, still glitchy in areas that should have been ironed out by now Elden Ring is basically Dark Souls 4, for better and for worse, with every step forward in design there seem to be two steps back, for a game described as being more RPG oriented and more open world it feels like much of it is still oriented very much around the combat, which in itself isn't bad, but even the combat has changed for the worse. ultimately many promises were brought with the game and some of them just were not fulfilled. an open world of untold proportions was promised, and for the first three zones it is, but the late game areas become increasingly empty and bland, the horse combat was promised to be new and fun but it seems so poorly optimized its hard to imagine it wasn't just tacked on at the end. Difficulty is incredibly schizophrenic. Boss fights in the late game seem poorly designed and become less challenging battles and more of tests of patience for when their year long combos will end. all in all more of the same and different in the worst ways. A good game marred with incredibly low lows, but a good game for people who are more about the souls-like brand. an incredibly polarized game for an incredibly polarized age. TLDR: not the worst game in the world, not the best",6,2022-08-09,PLAYSTATION 5
AceAscendus,"By far the worst souls game ever made, the open world is extremely boring and full of copy+paste content. There is no fun way to traverse the open world. Boss fights are low quality and again a lot of them are copy+paste, I am talking about big story bosses that get shamelessly reused! It shows that FromSoftware didn't have enough time to develop this game properly. The boring empty open world is filled with wannabe pokemon summons called spirit ashe summons, you like collecting pokemons in your souls games? I don't. There is no meaningful reward, the game is too big for its own good, next time provide less quantity and more QUALITY, like previous souls games.",0,2022-08-09,PLAYSTATION 5

After a first few hours a bit stressful in which you get the mechanics the game became a delight, just what everyone says. But this relationship was broken after 70 hours, when you reach the final stretch of the game. That friend you think you know changes and shows his true nature. The game gives way to despair with enemies and areas completely unbalanced. No matter if you have gone slowly and exploring, as in my case, you are not able to defeat any boss without throwing away hours. Sickening stuff. The game is in its final stretch completely unbalanced. Unless you play with a specific class and build it is impossible to advance naturally. What's worse, you stop caring about the story and stop appreciating its amazing design. A pity after all those good times I had at the beginning.

huraka13,"Primer comentaré que no sóc un fan de la saga dark souls, he jugat bastants jocs pero mai m'han semblat obres mestres, mai fins ara. Elden ring ha sabut conjugar el millor de la saga i el millor de la llibertat dels móns oberts, no es tracta de que el joc ofereix una quantitat desorbitada de contingut, sinó de com el presenta. Tot en aquest món està cobert de misteri, tot sembla que busqui despertar la teva curiositat, és increïble com aconsegueix mantenir-te donant voltes sense un objectiu clar i que tot i així no decaigui l'interès del jugador en cap moment. La quantitat d'opcions i alternatives per fer front als enemics és inmensa i serà difícil que no trobis un estil de joc en el que et sentis còmode, aquesta és una altre de les millores respecte d'altres entregues, tens mil opcions per adaptar el joc al teu gust, i això pot arribar a ser realment gratificant. Per tots aquells que tinguin por de la dificultat, tinc bones notícies, el joc es exigent, però per primera vegada a la saga, si simplement explores i millores l'equipament i el nivell (cosa que succeïx de manera natural) pots fer front a tots els enemics d'una forma bastant senzilla.

This work is considered a revolution in the video game industry and it is the creator of a new style of Souls games, which is a combination of Souls, dark fantasy, and open world, or rpg. I can't really say what else to describe this masterpiece. I can say with certainty that I have played at least 80% of all the games in the gaming world that have been released for PC and PS, and among all of them, I have never seen anything like this, even in Red. Dead Redemption 2, GTAV, Witcher 3, and Horizon, which we all know are among the best in the open world and have a lot of graphics and art in terms of the map and game world, I think this game could have gotten a higher score from the critics if it had better graphics. Because the critics have always proven that they value games with high graphics even if they are not good games and they magnify them for no reason, and this is exactly the only problem with this game. Besides all the beauties of this game, there is only one problem. It is also thisLike the story games that I don't want to name and they don't have a long and interesting story and only focus on their graphics, it couldn't focus only on the graphics, the only problem with this game is that it couldn't raise the graphics like the other graphic games of this generation. I think he is right because all the graphic games of the new generation, which I won't name because of their fans, used copies and everywhere in the game world is like this, but Alden Ring has put a new adventure in all the points of the game and He made the whole game world with high details, he didn't just copy a plain or forest or the previous area and change its details a little and call the game open world, like many open world games that do exactly the same thing and have no content. There is no goodness in their world, and this is something that the creators of Elden Ring have focused on instead of giving gamers a garbage world with only high graphics. And in the end, I would like to thank all those who worked hard to make this work of art",10,2022-07-31,PLAYSTATION 5

wolfdamone,"For those who love to be immersed in a beautiful game design, somber atmosphere with epic boss battles, Please don't miss this masterpiece. I personally love environment story telling type of games. It might arguably be the easiest Souls game (in my humble opinion) but as a result, it's an excellent entry for starters in the From software formula. I can however understand the frustration of casual gamers, this kind of game is not for everyone. it requires the pleasure of persevering, the pleasure of learning and improving yourself through the struggle and the unknown. A ""great"" game can gather most people's opinion, but a ""masterpiece"" can sometime divide. I will conclude by saying this. This game has so mush love put into it, it has a soul... and the emotion you feel as you struggle in this world will give you one of the most satisfying feeling you will ever have in a video game after succeeding.

So this time I knew to not buy Elden Ring and instead try playing a copy a friend of mine bought. Really glad I didn't get it.

Spell_666,"Terminado con 100 horas de juego y nivel de personaje 125. La sensación general del juego es que se ha intentado innovar en la formula Souls metiendo el mundo abierto con la esencia y mecánicas de los Souls. El resultado final no es satisfactorio ya que en muchos aspectos falla. El diseño de los enemigos y jefes es feo y poco inspirado. A mi personalmente no me han gustado y creo que se podrían haber trabajado más a nivel artístico. Los paisajes en cambio si se ven mejor y son de mayor calidad. Además se han reciclado descaradamente de juegos anteriores enemigos y jefes. Las invocaciones de las cenizas eran una idea buena pero está mal ejecutada ya que no tiene sentido que solo se puedan utilizar en ciertos momentos y no estén disponibles siempre. El caballo lo mismo, hay veces en los que no aparece disponible sin ninguna justificación. El caballo y las invocaciones deberían ser compañeros de aventura y deberíamos ser libres de utilizarlos siempre que queramos y no solo cuando el juego quiera. El crafteo de materiales para la creación de objetos se utiliza muy poco y es algo que se nota que está poco trabajado. La historia y el lore es muy completo y profundo como en todos los Souls. Como siempre tendrás que investigar tu ya que el juego no te cuenta nada de forma directa. Las localizaciones y situaciones que se producen durante el juego al final se repiten y dan ganas de dejar el juego. Los castillos, los campamentos de soldados, las torres, las ciénagas, cuevas y las mazmorras se repiten por todo el mundo cambiando solo pequeños detalles. Tienes muchas historias paralelas de los NPC que jugar y misiones secundarias que alargan la duración del juego y eso es de lo poco positivo del juego. El multijugador es como en todos los Souls, lo utilizas cuando se te atasca algún jefe final como fue en mi caso. Solo lo utilicé para las 2 últimas peleas de jefes finales. No hay ninguna novedad al respecto. Yo personalmente fui a completar directamente la historia principal para pasarme el juego lo antes posible ya que se me estaba haciendo muy largo y quería terminarlo contra antes. Una vez me lo he terminado no me dan ganas de retomarlo para completar las misiones secundarias que me faltan. Me he pasado Demons Souls, Demons Souls remake, Dark Souls 1 y Bloodborne. Este Elden Ring para mi está un escalón por debajo de todos ellos y creo que el hecho de ser un mundo abierto le ha hecho más mal que beneficio. La formula original de los Souls se pierde en parte y se difumina bastante.",5,2022-07-18,PLAYSTATION 5

ojciecmatki,"As someone that has never played the FromSoftware game, I was really surprised by how engaging this game is from the very start. The gameplay is great and while some bosses/mobs are being reused I have never felt like I have to do something again. The graphics could be a little better but the world is pretty amazing and most of the time I was surprised by how beautiful and unique each place is. While you can't change the difficulty you can still use certain things to make it easier (use broken builds/spells, use ashes or even call someone for help). This is the first single-player game that I have put 100hours+ into so it says something. Unlike other games, the sidequests (if you can call them that) are really unique (and long) and actually make an impact on the ending. There was always something to do in that game for me and it was a great adventure. I recommend this game to anyone. That being said that are two things that lower the rating for me: 1. Effort that they have put into Ending(s) (cinematics etc) is very minimal. After 100 hours of gameplay, I would expect something more than 20-second video that doesn't show basically anything. Yes, I could imagine what was the outcome but still, this is a very easy thing to fix. That's probably because most endings reuse other cinematics. It seems like they just didn't care about ending presentation, 2. While the sidequests and ""main"" quest are great the lack of any tracker (or even something that saves the dialogues so you can check what they have said) really lowers the experience. How am I supposed to understand (especially at the beginning) where some NPC will go or where I should go if I have never visited the place before. It's not like you will be at that place soon, it can take hours to land in the place where NPC is. That's the case if they tell you where they are, sometimes they just relocate without telling you. What really struck me in all of that is that some questlines can be broken if you progress too far in another one - so not only do you have no idea where to go you also might go in the wrong direction and ruin some questline. If you wish to experience all questlines you basically have to check on the phone where NPC will be and what NOT TO DO in order to not break them. That really lowers the experience. 3. Close to the endgame it seems like FromSoftware didn't know what to do with normal enemies so they just increased their health and damage output and called it a day. I don't mind strong enemies but that just seemed random. I went from one place to another (literally next to each other) and the difficulty increased by like 300%.",9,2022-07-16,PLAYSTATION 5

For new comers the mechanics are not user friendly, but nothing impossible to get if you actually keep playing the game. Graphics are pretty and the story is great. I am playing in quality and haven’t have any issue with frame rate. Only real complaint might be the fact that there is not a quest log, and by this I mean like a notebook or a diary, not a quest finder. There are a lot of quests and NPC interactions that are easily missable for the Nate fact that you forgot about the quest, soy you might end up reaching some place and killing the boss only to much later discover that you wrecked a quest haha.

And that also goes for the story, which by the way is the dumbest **** I have ever heard. A story where you would have to collect tax from Marika would make more sense than this mess.

Awanka,"Dark Souls 4, and lord of open world games. Enormous. It took me longer than Skyrim, Witcher 3, or AC: Valhalla including all of the DLC for those games. The time spent in Elden Ring was also of a much higher quality, filled with personalized dungeons and difficult combat, whereas other giant open-world games contain a lot of cookie cutter dungeons, repetitive missions, and tedious action sequences. My biggest problem with most open-world games is that the combat becomes face-roll after the first 1/2 of the game. Although not perfect, Elden Ring's combat balance is far more tuned, and even at the very end, the player will encounter the most difficult challenges in the game. There are some annoyances. Portals that can teleport you to other side of map. Once was cute. After that It became obnoxious. The game is almost too much. Too much Dark Souls if that is possible.

AigleAveugle,"30 hours in and be sure I'm not letting go of this game until I have done every quests, find all items and killed all bosses. This game is awesome ! Only complaints (and they are minor ones): Npcs are somewhat non-elaborate, static and soft. There isn't much life or actions by them so far maybe it will change late game but I doubt it. Some enemy attacks, Bosses or traps are linked to what button you press, making the action predictable and loosing immersion. Looks like you are puppeteering the target with the controller... Why every soul like game must make the aiming/zoom mechanics of archery so old-school ? I know there is lots of different looking area in this game but some assets in large open portions of the same landscapes are copy-past like buildings, pillars and irregularities in the surroundings. Everything else is great. This game deserves its reputation. I hope every other companies out there take note and KILL their stupid compass and maps showing everything like your a newborn needing to be fed and learns what a real open world should be like.

naki_biga,"As you can see, the game is being bombed with bad reviews, do not trust them. Elden Ring is one of the most carefully designed games in the last years, especially in level design and mechanics. It obviously follows its predecessors Souls games but refines every aspect of it, combat is more dynamic and have plenty of new mechanics, it is not an R1 smasher anymore, it have the biggest variety of abilities and spells, history is intricated, gameplay challenging at any time, and the map is huge. After 60 hours of gameplay, I am still being impressed of the size, the locations, its atmosphere and how small they make me feel. It is, a game with an initial steep learning curve, and give you little info and nowhere to check it. If you have a quest, you need to remember it, you wont have a HUD telling you everything to do, just like real life. It is challenging and it demands you to die a lot, but every dead is not a failure but a chance to learn. But hey, it is an open world that is filled with many, many things (don’t listen to other reviews, Assassin’s Creed is an empty map, not Elden Ring), so if you are stuck on a boss, maybe you should just go somewhere else and come back with better level and skills. Being an open world and allowing you to tackle bosses and difficult situations later on, makes a more accessible game that other Souls, that are more lineal and forces you to kill a boss or you cannot advance. For me, being a Souls fan since Demon Souls, it feels like a step forward, a beautiful game filled of experiences and adventures, and I am sure many people will enjoy it. This said, if you use to play with all aids, in easy mode, and you are not used to challenges, and want to feel overpowered and simply smash buttons, this is not your game. You will get frustrated as it demands mental calm.",10,2022-07-06,PLAYSTATION 5

There are numerous positive sides: 1) There are numerous beautiful places that are an eye feast. 2) The multiplayer changed, which I liked. Now, you can only be invaded if you already started a multiplayer section (i.e., summoned a co-op). Thus, it feels fairer, since before you could get invaded and mobed by the invader and the monsters. 3) Boss fights are epic. 4) Faith build FINALLY is good and viable for TRUE combat. Now faith builds have multiple options for attacks and heavy blows, not just some boosts and healing. 5) Amazing choices for unique weapons with unique attacks. 6) The world is absurdly big. To fully explore everything (and do some grinding) it took me around 130h in a single playthrough. 7) A lot of things to randomly do and explore in the open field. 8) You do have an absurdly amount of choices of possible builds. Like..a lot. 9) Crafting: now you can craft things instead of just buying them or looting, great. 10) 'Rune"" mechanics is way better than ""humanity"", you will see. 11) Possibility of concocting your own custom potion for special effects. 12) Leveling takes fewer ""souls"" per level. 13) Way more charges for your HP/Mana recharge. 14) The game is full of bosses, not just major ones. 15) Overall fun and addictive. 16) Multiple chances of respecting your stats to try new builds! The negative: 1) Unbalanced fights. You will feel like you are always behind the game. You will NEED to grind some levels. You will be 20 levels above the game area, and you will have powerful weapons for the area, but you will fight a boss and feel that you are just slowly chopping down a tree. Some bosses have an absurd amount of health. I rarely called co-operators in DS1-3, Demon Souls, and Bloodborne. I rellied a lot in co-ops in Elden Ring. 2) I felt that the AI is not polished. It is not about AI like the other FS games, it is about taking insane amounts of damage and infinite chains of combos. I counted, some ""elite enemies"" can make a 12-15 hit chain. It is like all enemies are Hunters from Bloodborne. 3) Monster looks like it wights 50000 Kg? It will be fast. Does Knight use heavy armor and a massive sword? He will be fast. The enemy is not fast? He will have fast projectiles. 4) Being sincere, the graphics are not better than DS3. However, this is a PS5 game, and the graphic did not change. It doe snot bother me, but you expect differently. 5) You have hundreds of choices of builds, but you will eventually choose one with bloodloss because bloodloss is just broken in Elden Ring. Combine bloodloss and frostbite and you will be playing the game as easier as it gets. 6) Some regions are just too frustrating. I am not kidding, some regions of the game will just not be enjoyable at any level - neither visually, nor in terms of loot, nor it will be cool to fight enemies; 7) Numerous enemies and bosses have recycled moves from other FS games. I understand devs doing that, but man, it is a lot of recycling. At some points you just make this face (-.-). 8) They screwed up the quests. In any other FS game, you get attached to some NPCs, you want to know more about their stories, and more importantly, you can follow their story and kinda know what you need to do or where to go. Now, you just don't care. You will care for 5-6 NPCs in the game (from dozens), and the rest is just irrelevant. You will skip most quests because you will either not find the NPC while exploring, or you will just not know what to do. I think that I finished like 5 quests, from the dozens of quests available. For most of them, I did even know what to do, or what they wanted. Likewise, they generally give something irrelevant in the end. 9) Low replay value. Before, you wanted to go to NG+ for new weapons, build improvements, etc. Now, you can basically do everything in one playthrough. You will do more just for the other endings. Overall, it is a great game, but it is not a 10, or ultra innovative like they sell to you. It is an enjoyable game, a great FS title, fun, addicting, with tons of features/fights/lands that you will love, but it has some bumps on the road that will get under your skin sometimes.",7,2022-07-01,PLAYSTATION 5

thodgson,"You will spend over 100 hours exploring, fighting, and dying (over and over). Much of this time is spent trying to figure out what you should be doing to advance the story-line which is murky at best. Don't get me wrong, I found the game enjoyable and satisfying on many levels; however, I don't think I would have made it to the end without a guide, and even then it was frustrating and challenging (good and bad). Game of the year contender? Critics all rave about it, so what does my opinion matter? Because I'm here to tell you that it is flawed in many ways that are inexcusable. Namely, the story is a bit of a mess and ""quests"" are a mystery shrouded by layers of contempt by From Software to those who dare ask for more guidance than arrows pointing you to something, something, something.",8,2022-06-30,PLAYSTATION 5

shundog,"I have played videogames since the early 90s. Over the years, I’d given up hope on a mainstream title ever surpassing the games I played in my youth. However, after experiencing Elden Ring in it’s entirety, I can unequivocally say that it is my favorite game of all time. If you love soulsborne games, then you MUST play this. It IS a masterpiece. I truly cannot imagine a better game. As far as the story: it is much more complete than previous Fromsoft games, likely owing to GRRM’s contributions. It is not a cinematic experience like most modern mainstream titles, it is still largely in the background, but it’s very compelling. Gameplay is fantastic. Melee, ranged, magic, and hybrid builds are all viable. The combat is the best of any soulsborne game. Boss fights are challenging, but fair. My only criticism is that several boss fights seem to be designed with the intent that you use a spirit summon. Which is ok, but I feel like spirits trivialize a lot of the content. Re-used bosses do not bother me. In fact, I think it’s neat to fight a boss again after you’ve leveled and augmented your build. With the amount of content this game gives, roughly 80-100 hours, I think such a criticism is completely bogus. The open world design is the best I’ve experienced in any title. It is detailed and nuanced. There is a great deal of verticality in the terrain which makes exploring non-trivial even after you’ve discovered the map for a location. There are also many hidden dungeons, locations, and secrets. On my first play through, I attempted a 100% run (without a guide), going over every area multiple times, and I still missed some content. In my opinion, the low reviews are either from the casual crowd who aren’t used to the difficulty, or fake paid reviews to bash the game. Yes this game is challenging, but I find it is the easiest soulsborne game to date. The difficulty in this game is tuned very well. It is not unfair nor tedious. It doesn’t hold your hand, which most gamers are probably used to, but that is what makes the game feel rewarding. 10/10",10,2022-06-28,PLAYSTATION 5
painava,"Obtained platinum trophy in ~170 hours at lvl 192. Not interested in co-op/PvP, played offline. The wondrous and massive world of the Lands Between is literally awesome, the lore intriguing and captivating. Exploring the castles and wilderness, caves and catacombs quickly became an addiction. There are some performance issues but I'm not that bothered by them. Still, the performance isn't anything to write home about. There also aren't any DualSense features on PS5. Since Elden Ring has been widely praised, my review focuses on criticism. My biggest complaint is that many of the enemies and bosses feel disappointingly unbalanced, which is a big issue when a game centers around combat. A band of towering giants with flaming swords? Who cares, bring it on! But see those rats sniffing about? You better run or die in a ditch. Many basic enemies, like dogs, deal more damage than the bosses. How is that intentional? There are bosses that offer a fair and fun challenge, but many (or even the majority) of them are just ridiculous. Either they're too strong, tanky and fast or total pushovers. Who's going to die in two hits, me or the boss? When the hard ones aren't already hard enough they come in pairs (yay...) and the weak ones die to a couple of swings (that's it?). When so many of the bosses fall into these two extremities, it means that many of the fights aren't particularly fun nor memorable. They feel repetitive or anticlimactic. The hard bosses are prone to extremely delayed attacks, likely to throw off souls veterans. Their AoE attacks and combos deal massive damage. Even if you survive one with a sliver of HP left, the bosses are often scripted to attack when you heal, so a lot of the challenge boils down to making zero mistakes. Add spirit summons, one of the major additions to the series, to the mix and many of the fights feel like they have almost random odds of victory. Many boss fights have clearly been designed with spirit summons (what the gatekeepers refer to as ""easy mode"") in mind so they're definitely part of the intended gameplay. I still wish more bosses had been designed solely for single-player (no spirit/NPC summons) like in the previous games. I shudder to wonder how big a pain in the ass a spiritless run would be. FromSoftware had already perfected the ""souls-like boss"" in their previous games. Elden Ring proves that these games work better in a more focused and linear setting. Don't get me wrong, I'm absolutely enjoying the game (plenty of bosses included), but it doesn't strike me as FromSoft's greatest work yet. The gameplay feels oddly dissatisfying during certain fights. A handful of other complaints: Considering how vast Elden Ring is, it's baffling how vague and directionless the NPC quests are, to say the least. Trying to figure out where an NPC has moved requires more blind luck than anything else. I don't need the exact location on the map, but I'd prefer a few hints to Fextralife. Item/magic quick select feels quite old-fashioned. They should've implemented something more modern (similar to e.g. TLOU or Dishonored). L3 as the sneak/dismount button is frustrating, to put it mildly, but I haven't suffered accidental dismounts since switching L3 and ↓, allowing me to change items easily while walking. The map markers feel lacking, there should be more options or different colors. Can't compare the equipment in the shop menu. Fall damage feels inconsistent. Most items seem almost redundant. The best content in Elden Ring are the legacy dungeons, like the Stormveil Castle or the Volcano Manor. The peerless level design makes the exploration so damn satisfying and fun. Character design and art direction are thoroughly superb, even breathtaking at times. Elden Ring has improved many aspects of the ""soulsborne experience"", but for me, it doesn't reach the heights of Bloodborne, Dark Souls or Sekiro. I would still recommend it to anyone interested in challenging action RPGs and open-world games, however, if the next FromSoft game turns out to be yet another Dark Souls, I'll pass.",7,2022-06-28,PLAYSTATION 5

boltron,"Elden Ring could have been one of the greatest video games of all time, but it turned out to be mediocre at best, and is definitely the weakest of the Souls games if you look at the amount of effort that went into it. I don't know why the professional critic reviews are so high, I can only surmise they never had the time to play past the starting zone, because it's all downhill from there. On the plus side, the open world is a high point in gaming, and outshines anything I've seen before. It's hauntingly beautiful, richly detailed and full of surprises. That's about all the good I can say about this game. The negative is that the combat is a complete mess. It's not that it's difficult, it's just wildly inconsistent, and a huge disappointment compared to the finely-tuned likes of Bloodborne. One of Elden Ring's biggest draws is the massive array of weapons and play styles it gives you - all of which is a complete lie. There is really only one way to play this game - caster. Get the cookie cutter caster build that everyone is playing. If you like random death a lot more you can go melee, in which case there are two less enjoyable cookie cutter builds for that. Everything else is like trying to cut through solid rock with soggy toilet paper. The boss fights are amazing and memorable - in other Souls games. Meanwhile in Elden Ring, they went with quantity, so you have lots of the same copy/paste encounters, and in many of them you'll be fighting not just a boss, but also the buggy camera, the clippy terrain, and the absurd melee range mechanics that are there to remind you to play a caster. FromSoft games have a reputation for being difficult but fair, but ER is neither of those, it's just random and unfair. It's pretty common for bosses to double or triple punish you for mistakes with overlapping, poorly-telegraphed attacks, but hey, all of this can be avoided - Play. A. Caster. Pushing through this game wasn't fun, it felt more like a job, and when I was done I felt no sense of accomplishment. I celebrated by firing up Dark Souls III for a few hours so I could wash the taste out of my mouth and remind myself that From mostly makes really good games. I won't revisit The Lands Between - there are far better games out there worth trying, and that's a shame - under the trash gameplay, Elden Ring's amazing world has gone to waste.",5,2022-06-25,PLAYSTATION 5

jacek_1805,"I spent many hours with this game on my PS5 playing solo, and I made it somewhere halfway. I was helping myself with the ""Elden Ring no death speedrun"" video posted on YouTube. Even with the help of this video, the boss fights are extremely difficult and most of the fights have to be repeated several dozen times until, by a lucky coincidence, the boss is defeated. After one fight, which you repeated several dozen times, after many days of struggle, you go to the next fight, to which you have to spend many days again. Plot? Passing the game halfway through, I didn't notice any significant changes to the storyline. Nothing, emptiness. No incidents, the world around you remains as it was at the beginning.

crescentsky,"Could be better. I'll start with the cons first. Biggest issue is the quest system is so poorly done and it isn't obvious to follow. Fromsoft tried to fix this by adding in markers but the quests itself are still confusing as you don't know where NPCs will go. There is also a significant number of reused content throughout the world. I lost count how many times I fought the Erdtree watchdog boss and lost interest with all the repeated enemies. Another flaw I felt was the multiplayer, why does this game still have a dated multiplayer pulled straight from Dark Souls? Speaking of Dark Souls this may as well just be called Dark Souls 4 with the similar summon/invasion system with an almost identical story. Not to mention... the same UI. Pros is thatI like that the world is huge with a sense of discovery. The mounted combat at least with magic is pleasant and intuitive. A lot of enemies are well designed and the biomes all feel different on their own. I enjoy that there are many secrets that reward those that check every nook and cranny. My favorite location had to have been the academy as it felt really interesting with all it's magic type enemies. The spellcasting system is much more rewarding than before which I found myself using more than a melee playthrough. To Fromsoft, please make sure on the next game to update the UI. I'm tired of seeing a LONG HP/MP/Stamina bar and seeing icons of what equipment I am wearing. Update the multiplayer, what is up with the summoning/invasion from another world nonsense that is pulled from Dark Souls? If you are going to make another open world please consider a quest system or make it more obvious where NPCs will go or give an indicator that you could be breaking a quest chain.",6,2022-06-20,PLAYSTATION 5

AshenWon,"FROM yet again use their Midas touch to create yet another masterpiece. The cooperative accessibility really helped propel this game into being my favourite SoulsBourne title. It’s open world, while not revolutionary, is significantly delivered better than most other AAA titles. I think this has to do with how it still doesn’t really hold your hand. Commonly, waypoints destroy the immersion and sense of exploration and wonder, but Elden Ring doesn’t ‘instruct you at all times’. It merely points you in the right direction and it does it so well you may not even consciously realise. The graphics have improved, as they tend to on each title. They fall slightly short of the Demons Souls remake, but it can easily be forgiven for the sheer scale of Elden Ring which impossibly seemed to get bigger and bigger throughout my playthrough. The story is very reminiscent of FROMs predecessors. I don’t think I have the patience or mental capacity to understand it all (I’ll stick to YouTube deep dives to explain character relationships and further lore). It’s quite deep and complex, but the core objective is Dark Souls nuance. Tons of value for money, a game that will be cherished for generations. It’s a remarkable feat, and while not everyone enjoys these types of games, they should certainly take the gamble if they are on the fence.",10,2022-06-19,PLAYSTATION 5
HyperionHere,"This game is a very broken masterpiece. Its open world is beautiful, although quite repetitive by the end. The Catacombs or Dungeons spread throughout the world get boring very quickly, although that's quite common in lots of games. The Boss battles are either laughably easy or excruciatingly unfair, and the high difficulty in some bosses may lead to most players just using the same broken builds to compensate for the piss poor balancing and boss design. Gank bosses AI is some of the worst, leading to you fighting two very aggressive enemies at the same time in a room with almost no way to split aggression. All that said, still a decent game, but nowhere near the quality of the other games Fromsoft has made outside of Dark Souls 2.",6,2022-06-18,PLAYSTATION 5

Kamikazeshocki,"Edit: 190 hours in I achieved Platinum. You can call me M'Lord and the rating still stands. I completed every former Soulsborne game and came straight from Horizon Forbidden West to this one. After ignoring the huge technical fidelity difference between both titles it is like always: Technically not on par with current gen but the design aesthetics in landscape and buildings and monster make it look good anyway. I for 99% did not encounter frame rate issues, just noticed some in one particular area. I guess that got patched or people are exaggerating. I am currently 80h in and since I couldn't stop myself from exploring and trying every boss I found I am apparently at only 60% of content right now. From Software truly delivered what they tried: Dark Souls in open world works surprisingly well and you still got enough linear segments that are really awesome. I really dug the underground levels and all legacy dungeons so far. I cannot imagine what I want to do if I completed this game, I already play it almost everyday. The people that criticize the game design related to open world should watch some youtube videos why elden ring is actually making something stale into something very good, like Zelda did somehow in 2017. I actually want to explore every niche and never got bored! At horzon Zero Dawn I got bored (still ~very good game, just for broad masses) and it is obviously that Elden Ring does not nurture the obvious open world boredom. You need to explore by yourself and you will miss a ton of actually rewarding stuff (if you don't look at wiki :)) Also I think it is the best game for starting with a Soulsborne game for people that got scared due to the difficulty of former games. Not that it is easier, but you will ""almost never"" rage quit since the last checkpoint is never far away and you have multiple solutions and areas to tackle a problem. The exact contrary to Sekiro and Bloodborne (which I loved most actually). This is the game of the year to me, it is so huge and full of rewarding stuff and battles and I don't see anything that might top that in overall score. Just buy this gem, git gud and get lost in it. See you online fellow Tarnished and might we encounter each other at some jolly cooperation. (The unusual multiplayer concept works well as always.)",10,2022-06-18,PLAYSTATION 5

I don’t really understand people who criticize the graphics and frame rate on PS5 since I love the art style (which I think is more important than graphics) and it was a solid 60fps though most of my play through. I love almost everything about this game but there are a few things I can criticize. First I’m going to go into some combat problems. First there are some almost undodgable attacks like (SPOILERS) the notorious waterfowl dance which is almost impossible to doge unless you are really skilled or lucky. There are some other attacks but that’s the major one. I also feel some weapons are way too unbalanced like old ROB and moonveil. Overall still super fun. Now into exploration. Coming back to places that you are way to strong for **** but considering the alternative is enemy’s scaling with you it’s decent.

Its mainly the terrible boss design, I get killed at full health in two hits while taking 30 minutes to recover from the last attack! And to just arrive at the boss fight, you have to deal with a plethora of nuisances that deal unreasonable amounts of damage. And by late game, you can only really level up your character and weapons by killing the bosses that kill you in less that 10 seconds. What really aggravated me and lots of other Elden Ring players was the Godskin Duo, the most annoying boss in the entire game. They are near impossible to fight without dying immediately. I know Elden Ring has one of the largest and most detailed maps, good graphics, and is a great challenge, but it all comes down to how much fun and joy you can have. There is no fun and joy in this. Zero. It is mentally draining to play. You should only buy Elden Ring if you an absurd amount of time on your hands and if you hate yourself.",0,2022-06-16,PLAYSTATION 5

Sgmiller,"In all my many years of gaming, I have never seen a more overrated and overhyped game. I say that as somebody who adored every single Dark Souls game as well as Bloodbourne and others of a similar type such as Nioh and Nioh 2. The moment I stepped foot into Elden ring, I felt nothing but massive disappointment. I started as a Wretch and wandered around for hours looking for a single piece of usable gear without success. There was not a single moment of the spellbinding tension of the other souls games nor was the exploration particularly interesting as compensation. In fact, I don't think I enjoyed a single moment and ended up just giving up and deleting the game and never looking back. Man oh man what a disappointment that was. No idea what game the reviewers were playing but it couldn't possibly have been this one. ""Best game ever?"" After this debacle, I will never again buy a game based on professional reviews",3,2022-06-15,PLAYSTATION 5
TheDoomOfDayne,"While the game isn't perfect, as none are, I think this game accomplishes more than any previous souls game in terms of managing to maintain its infamous difficulty while also being easier for new players to engage with due to the new open world setting.

jepeace,"This is hands down the game of the year. Fantastic game play, beautiful open world, massive amount of things to do, while still allowing go getters to complete the game in a timely manor. Awesome replay ability with PvP aspects, and Co-op PvE aspects. Ton's of great weapons and armor for an RPG, and difficult but fair game play. If you play only one RPG this year, make it Elden Ring. One very tiny complaint, the NPC quest lines can be hard to follow with out a guide, but it's a very minor thing.",10,2022-06-14,PLAYSTATION 5

ChainsawMcConel,"The Game looks very good, the mechanics is Dark Souls typical with some new features like the Horse or the ability to jump. The Open World is quite big (for my Taste way to big). Open World and Dark Souls is a new concept which i was a little sceptical about because for me, Open World isnt a Feature i need in every Game, it needs to fit to the Type of Game. As example, a open World in a Fallout Game is absolutely great. For a Dark Sousish Game, i dont know if a huge World is needed. What was quite annoying to me is the fact that you need to craft a Medicin to be able to play with others. Why da Hell should this be a good feature? It would have been way better if it would have been a permanent Item. I can imagine especially for new Players, its going to get more than frustrating,",7,2022-06-14,PLAYSTATION 5

yousifalraheem,"This game is absolutely fantastic. I have never played a game that kept me interested for as long as the game lasted. The first few minutes of the game are not that interested because you don't know the scale of this world and what it has in store for you. But once you start to understand that part, it will blow your mind. I often find myself lost in the map just to stumble upon something incredible that would hook me for the next few hours. Secret dungeons, hidden worlds, weird modes of transportation, traps. This is a masterpiece. The graphics aren't that good to be honest, but it really didn't matter because the game was more enjoyable that anything else in the market. I guess the next milestone that FromSoftware need to reach is a visual fidelity. It will do this game justice because the level design is from another world.",10,2022-06-13,PLAYSTATION 5
CptCaleb,"After about 120hrs, Elden Ring is definitely good, but I’d hardly call it revolutionary. Either soulsbourne games are for you or they aren’t, so I think it’s unfair for anyone to rate this game based on just being in that genre with its tropes of difficulty and all that (which seems to be precisely what’s happening). So aside from that this game has benefited from From Soft’s reputation and critical praise. I heard a lot of praise about how this game has changed open world games forever and raised the bar. Don’t get me wrong, Elden Ring is good, but I can’t for the life of me imagine what everyone thinks is new here? Or maybe not new but far better than any other game has done it? It definitely meets the bar, but I think it’s a stretch to say it sets it. In that regard, I’m not a fan of the omission of some basic open world elements (like a quest log). Even this sort of thing has received praise—which again I don’t think would have happened if it wasn’t a From game. It’s definitely a good game, but if you’re not already a superfan of the developer then I wouldn’t go into it expecting it to be this life-changing experience it’s been built up to be. It took me well over 30 hrs to get into it *at all*, and even then I never had an “oh wow, this is awesome” moment with it. But plenty of “ah this is interesting; let’s check this out.”",8,2022-06-12,PLAYSTATION 5
Lord_Sunday,"This is a proper ""true"" open world. Huge variety in biomes, enemies, weapons, magic, and items. Some of the areas and things you discover are absolutely bonkers and one of a kind.

This game was perfect because I always felt like I could explore somewhere else that I could handle at my level. Is a boss hard? Just go back after you gain some levels! I never ran out of places to go at my current level. I didn’t explore just to grind levels, it was a genuine interest in seeing what was over there. I played 80 hours before I beat the game, thinking I had done everything I could. Turns out I missed A LOT! I didn’t even fight Mohg on my first play through! 80 hours of fun engaging gameplay, and I missed sooo much still! Can’t wait to see what they do next.",10,2022-06-12,PLAYSTATION 5

The game has so many different weapons and armor, and spells at use to fit anyone's play style, they have small swords, medium swords, big swords, COLOSSAL swords, even whips, hammers, axes, bows, ballistas, staffs! There are so many builds to use I can't even count them. Overall the game is just plain fun and should absolutely be on your shelf.",10,2022-06-11,PLAYSTATION 5
TFAReAper,"Elden Ring isn't just a game, it's a work of art. It is certainly one of the best games ever created by mankind. I understand that it doesn't suit all players, but no game does. In its niche, Elden Ring is king. Challenging combat level, it is necessary to learn and master the controls, you can create your build as you see fit for your style of gameplay. As for exploration, you are rewarded every 40 seconds walking or riding around the map: hidden items, unique enemies, bosses, spells, materials... Your experience will be unique when playing this game, because the possibilities are endless. My wish and dream is for all ARPG games to use Elden Ring as the basis for their development. All in all, the best game I've ever played.",10,2022-06-11,PLAYSTATION 5
Somy,"This game is absolutely magical in every way. It is not perfect, but for a game with over a hundred hours of content (my first playthrough took about 120 hours), it comes pretty darn close. Graphical fidelity may not be technically on par with the top AAA releases, but it more than makes up for it with its excellent art direction and attention to detail. I was in sheer astonishment at just how detailed many of the legacy dungeons were in terms of architecture, level design, and enemy variety. There must be over a hundred unique mob designs in this game without counting variations. The controls are similar to older Dark Souls games, so if you are familiar with those, you'll feel right at home here. However, I think they feel even more responsive here, with the addition of the jump button and the freedom that comes with it. The combat is wonderful, with it feeling weighty but not sluggish; deep but not overly complex. This game is the embodiment of ""hard, but fair"", even more so than older FromSoft titles. Never have I felt that a death was cheap or unwarranted. The story may be hidden at first glance, but nevertheless it manages to be very poignant. The lack of cutscenes and dialogue simply make the times when you do get one of them stand out more. I won't delve too deep for fear of spoilers, but there are a few scenes that I definitely will remember for a long time. The story and lore is hidden from plain sight, however it is quite detailed and unique. In traditional FromSoft fashion, you will need to pay attention to everything, every word of dialogue and every piece of text in the world and in the item descriptions, but if you do, you will be able to piece together a fascinating story that I personally think is book or movie-worthy. Overall, I think this game is absolutely deserving of the praise its gotten. It's astonishingly beautiful and outstanding in every way and squashed any doubts I had previously.",10,2022-06-11,PLAYSTATION 5

It took you guys 10 years, but you finally got there. Beating bosses is just a matter of memorizing patterns, while dodging endlessly. That's always been the case. There is no interesting tactics to beating a boss, it's highly repetitive, boring, and frustrating. Story telling is non-existent. And yes, it's always been the case with this series. It's called cutting costs. Performance and graphics are garbage, despite the strong and inspired art direction. That's also always been true with this series. RPG aspect is actually shallow, again, that's also always been true.

I managed to start reading my enemies, upgrading my armaments, traversing the world, completing Rannis questline and beat the game a couple of weeks ago. Through all the rage I had the best time with this game and I'm not even 100 percent done with it yet. For a game, I purchased it for $60, compared to other games, It's worth every cent.

Snek48,"The final boss of all souls games. A masterful game with so much to explore that I could honestly play for years. Beating the final boss was the most fulfilling thing ever. I could tell while playing this game that it was the finale of over a decade's worth of content. I think this is the last souls game, guys. There will likely be dlcs though, and while I'm looking forward to that, even after over 400 hours on the game I still am not bored and can wait as long as I like. As for the gameplay, it is excellent. It is different than the other souls games in that it is open world, but it's still a souls like at heart. The difficulty is high, like any other souls game, but when the going gets tough you can just do some side quests to get stronger, rather than banging your head against a boss that's too high level for you until you bleed out. The game allows for so much customization, rather that be all the awesome and unique weapons, the stylish armors, and even tons of spells and incantations. There are many different places to explore and many questlines and dungeons. Although some dislike the game for the amount of repetition, like repeated bosses, ruins, and enemies, I personally like that, it allows you to know what to expect when you enter a ruin, like after you find the cellar in gatefront, then another in waypoint, you know whenever you go into a ruin your immediate goal is to look for a cellar. Then, the game plays with those expectations and adds a trap in the cellar, or hide the cellar beneath and illusory wall. For me, this is easily the best game of all time, and I'm glad I got to experience it for myself.",10,2022-06-08,PLAYSTATION 5

propulsion,"This game is a great achievement. Yes it can be difficult, but you can always go do something else if an area or boss is too strong for your character. The world is a huge work of art, that is very dense, and essentially you start with weak gear, and decide how you will level your character for your play style and the loot you find. Eventually you will become powerful. Even though I didn’t play the other games from this developer, I want to now, as I was **** into the exploration, loot, character leveling, and getting good in the combat. One of the things I like about Returnal was the thrill that I could be killed at any moment. Elden Ring brings that thrill as well, and its refreshing because I was really only getting exciting thrills and emotion from online multiplayer games. As much as I love games like Spider-Man, God of War, Horizon, I never felt like I was going to have to overcome a challenge or walk into an area and be dead seconds later in those games. Returnal and now Elden Ring have been a breath of fresh air. They get me close to the thrill of a Destiny raid or an intense FPS online match, but in a single player game. Elden Ring does have multiplayer and it is easy to ignore if you want. My 10/10 is for the single player. I played the game solo and it’s one of my favorites of all time. I did not have any performance issues on PS5. If you are on the fence at least pick it up on sale, give it a chance to see if this type of game appeals to you.

Cimar,Elden ring is a masterpiece **** I could truly feel the coolness of this open world fantasy game and on any platform you play it on the game still delivers at the extremely high expectation for this game. The boss battles are so well made that even though I died over 50 times to one boss I kept on wanting to pick up the controller and continuing and when you do finish a boss fight you feel like you achieved something incredible. The story is enticing and makes me want to keep playing after 6 hours of consecutive games. The only issue I will bring up is that I feel like multiplayer is quite difficult to pull of it would be cooler if you could just invite your friend instead of crafting a remedy then using it and also then your friends could stay after either you or them die as it is quite annoying because they could die really quickly and then you would have to do the remedy again but that doesn't stop the game from being one of the best fantasy open world games out there. What makes it a breath-taking experience of the sheer size of the map I'm not too fond of an extremely big map where your just walking for years on end and not seeing anything which is why I love this game as you can always be stumbling across something new and their is never a lack of content. So if your looking for an open world fantasy game that ties you in so you can almost stop playing Elden Ring is the game for you.,8,2022-06-04,PLAYSTATION 5
insidiousmirage,Not for everyone but once you figure out how the game works it really is a masterpiece. One of the best games I have ever played without a doubt. The world design is absolutely amazing. I'm sure I missed some things but I really tried to explore everything in my first playthrough and it took me about 160 hours to complete. I can't wait for some dlx. I wish other games gave me this sense of wonder and the amount of content is just absurd. The scale is jaw dropping. I absolutely love the open world. I should beat some other games on my backlog but I have to start another playthrough.,10,2022-06-03,PLAYSTATION 5
N1ghtwing,"I'm not happy that I don't like this game more. It is a great game but I'm so sick of open world games. This is the easiest of all the soulsborne games. The brutal difficulty is gone. There are parts that are fantastic, but those moments are lost in the spread out open world. This is probably one of the best open world games ever made, so if you like open world you're in for a treat.",8,2022-06-03,PLAYSTATION 5
explosiooon,"World desing is so great; the RPG part is just like other souls, so it's good too, music and art are perfect and the graphics are ok. The only sin that this game have is repeat almost half of the bosses, and that maybe a lot of weapons use magic stats, so if you play dex or sthrength role, you'll probably lost grand part of the weapons. Anyway, this game deserves the GOTY and it's all the souls-like games in one, the great combination of all these kind of games. Don't pay attention to the bad users critics, the game is good, (is not perfect, but probably one of the best open world games), is definitely a must-play game and if someone says the opposite, it's just a hater.",9,2022-06-02,PLAYSTATION 5
livin_dreads,"What a blast! FromSoft has done it again, and boy oh boy have they delivered! Okay, so lets get the housekeeping out of the way.... ER doesn't have the greatest graphics, but that is no news From has NEVER gunned for graphic fidelity before if you expected it this time - jokes are on you. ""quests""? - I may sound like a smartarse when I state this, but Miyazaki has his own way of doing it... love it or hate it at the end of the day it's personal preference right? I understand that the PC version had some issues to begin with, it's a good thing this day and age games can be improved upon (which I believe they have done so). I myself have played (playing) it on my PS5, I am yet to come across any substantial chugging or straight up game breaking issues but i can only speak for myself. Now for the good stuff...... If you're a fan of the ""souls genre"" you have arrived to heaven! The game has by far the largest selection of unique weapons and fashion pieces (with the ability to alter the majority of them, thanks Boc) You can really create the ""hero"" of your dreams! Varity is the spice of life and ER delivers! I for one am happy to slam my head against the brick wall to go back over and over until my muscle memory develops for each enemy, but if unlike me you find yourself struggling you can go to soooooo many other locations to get stronger or just simply take a breather! I am **** at writing reviews, admittedly I am biased towards this series of games... Bottom line is, if you are expecting BOTW, Horizon (both are phenomenal games btw) or even Skyrim - you're fresh out of luck.. One does not walk into an Armani store looking for an extreme metal hoodie & bondage pants right?! I think they have shaken things up enough even if you aren't familiar with the series but possess some amount of patience to just stick with it untill it clicks..... there's a gleaming gem here!

Caidryn,"I will avoid giving this a rating to ""balance"" the ratings to where I feel they should be, and instead give my honest feelings. I consider myself a souls fan. I have completed every soulsbourne title Fromsoft has put out save for demon souls, some of them twice. Of them all, my personal favorite (though I hated it when I picked it up at first) was Sekiro. You would *think* that would mean I love this game, but instead... I felt betrayed. You will find review after review complaining about graphics and performance. Those things matter rather little to me, outside of crashes. What really hurt was the shift in design philosophy, for me. I played all of the Fromsoft games as a melee player, without summons. It's the way I enjoyed them. I loved the thrill of facing an enemy point blank, rolling through danger, dying a bunch, and eventually coming out on top. In terms of death to victory ratios, this game was probably about the same. But where every other game in the series adhered to ""Hard but Fair"", this game seemed to be explicitly aiming for ""Hard because *Unfair*"". Pretty much every major enemy has an unlimited combo of massively splashy hitboxes that will literally one shot you unless you throw your entire progression in the garbage in the name of Vitality, in which case you will be two shot instead. The enemies *literally* read your inputs, reacting before your character begins to move, literally speeding up animations to punish you for trying to punish them for missing an attack. Every enemy is hyper mobile, easily jumping behind you in the time it takes you to swing at them, even if you started the attack mid animation for them. This was fine in Sekiro. Sekiro was given the tools to handle them. A perfect, twitch reaction parry, with lightning fast strikes and ninja tools to counter them. In Elden ring, I have the tools of a Dark souls character, fighting endless Sekiro bosses. I put in well over a hundred hours, I was streaming the game intending to beat all of it that I could find on my first playthrough. I toiled through so much of it I disliked, hoping it would get better, or at least be inoffensive until the end. It was when I reached a snowy area with literal invisible assassins that command grab and execute you, making no sound, leaving no footprints in the snow that I decided I was well and truly done with the game. I threw my playstyle entirely in the trash, started summoning mimic, like pretty much everyone does, for every fight. Used a giant shield, because they're broken. Stopped doing any optional content. Cheesed enemies, like apparently everyone for some reason really enjoys with enemies in this game. I beat it, it felt gross and hollow, and also like exactly what the devs were trying to push me toward the entire game. If your only wish for a Fromsoft game was that it was as broad as an ocean, as shallow as a puddle, and every enemy aspired to be champion Gundyr, then this really is a must play for you. If, Like me, that sounds like a truly dead and barren world devoid of any joy, then congratulations Fromsoft. You have finally made a world so bleak that even those who love you can find no joy in it.",6,2022-06-01,PLAYSTATION 5
EgoRaInevitable,"This game is the most overrated game in some time. It is just dark souls 3 with open world. So naturally it will inherit everything wrong with that into this. Ok let me ask you question. Why do you like darks souls 3? Most people will say because of the bosses. But the thing is that the main gameplay loop - basically 70% of the game (which is the time spent going boss to boss) is absolutely trash. This is because the gameplay is super boring, clunky with outdated controls. Ok but you may say Elden Ring has open world. Its open world has the same problem as every other open world game. That being you can't make whole map full of new things. After Limgrave every other place is pretty much the same thing. Yes there will be some places which are unique but those are rare. There is no incentive to exploring places and enemies are just copy-pasted - there only so much dragons you can kill after you start pulling your hair. The gameplay is just bad, simply - absolutely atrocious. It feels like you in quick sand whilst the enemies are not. This is because the game has no cancelling - makes it so unresponsive. Most of the weapons are copies of each other and have no impact when using. It is quite sad, because if this game actually took inspiration from Bloodborne and Sekiro it would've been a much better game. Bloodborne's main gameplay loop is so much better, faster and has lot of impact. Bloodborne got rid of boring copy-pasted weapons and added trick weapons which are all pretty unique. But most importantly their ability to transform gives so many gameplay opportunities for combos and different strings.Also bloodborne and sekiro made the slow gameplay better by giving players the incentive to play fast and aggressively - got rid of the monotonous roll. There is so many reason why Bloodborne and Sekiro and better games, but I guess you get the point. Initially I was going to give this game 88, this was when I played it day one and finished it a week later. But in hindsight after thinking about all the flaws and not being blinding by hype - I can confidently say this game is no way 97 or a 85.",7,2022-06-01,PLAYSTATION 5
sergjoni,"У данной игры очень высокие оценки, и кто я такой чтоб занижать оценки этого шедевра. Это далеко не первая игра серии Souls для меня, я прошел все игры серии Souls за исключением Dark souls 1 -2. В целом, в чем моя проблема: -Больше не всегда лучше. Я провел окало 90 часов в ней и мне в какой-то момент просто надоело. Надоело то, что непонятно куда идти дальше. Ловишь себя на мысли что необходимо в очередной раз лезть за гайдом в ютуб. Да и главное мне пофиг, вот просто пофиг. Наверное, со мной что-то не то, но я вообще не уловил хоть толики повествования. -Наличие огромного и ненужного количества оружия. Наверное, это имеет смысл если ты проходишь игру по 2 или 3 раза и выкачиваешь различные билды. Я иногда просто не понимаю зачем мне другое оружие если основное вкачено максимально и наносит оптимальный урон. -Отсутствие новых механик. Крутые фишки, такие как парирование из Bloodborn или наличие стамины в Sekiro просто отсутствуют. В прошлых играх я чествовал схватку с боссом, в данной игре я просто чувствую, что я недостаточно прокачен для босса или наоборот перекачен. -Казуальность. Допускаю, что игра так зашла в массы тем, что просто превратилась в РПГ дрочильню где высокий уровень прокачки позволяет тебе побеждать. -Оптимизация. FPS в игре проседает от чего буквально болят глаза. При этом, графику выставлял на скорость, а не качество. В игре нет ничего выдающегося, чтоб так загружало Next gen консоль. В целом игра неплохая. Я провел в ней не один десяток часов и это что-то да значит. Просто игра не настолько хороша как ее оценивают критики.",5,2022-06-01,PLAYSTATION 5

The artistic, design, sound, exploration, immersion, combat, lore, enemy/area/boss/weapon/spell variety and size of the world are literally off the charts. It's also challenging while not being unfair and it gives you options to trivialise absolutely anything if you have no interest in the challenge.

I wasn’t very optimistic going into the game and haven’t enjoyed most modern games lately. especially open world games, they usually stress me out and make me burn out very fast. I was recommended by a friend to try this game out and hadn’t seen anything about it before purchasing. After only an hour of gameplay I was immediately hooked, I couldn’t stop playing. The open world pulled me in and immersed me without overwhelming me, I felt rewarded instead of side tracked. Being mostly an MMO player I was surprised at how much I enjoyed the vague quest design and story. It truly inspired me to figure things out on my own. After beating it 6 times in a short period of time I have since moved on to play all of fromsoft’s other games and beat all of them aswell.

Clayhead,"This is right up there with other masterpieces such as GTA V and Legend of Zelda BOTW, the sheer depth of the game and choice of characterisation in tackling it is staggering. I’m afraid those that have laid the accusation of it being a dull open world game have probably scratched the surface of what’s on offer. There are moments in the game which will stick with you forever such as the Tower of Caelid, Ainsel River Well, Deeproot Depths, just too many to mention. If you love Souls games , I certainly do, you will not regret persevering through the first few hours of this, yes, it’s open world and initially it’s confusing in terms of which path to take, but once it starts to click you will realise youre playing something special. You will never wait long for other players to help with awkward bosses, there seems to be a real community wanting to help others out in this respect. Build your character however you want, there’s the additions of crafting, also Ashes of War to add to your weapon, and Spirit Ashes to summon to help with challenging areas if you feel the need. I don’t understand those who criticise the graphics, one of , if not the best game ever created, the first three releases of World of Warcraft, existed on the same graphics engine for years. The graphics in Dark Souls are unique and have their own flavour, I love the fact they chose to continue with the same style and artwork. In addition combat always feels like you’re fighting something solid and tangible. The whole package just works in a way that most other games cannot come close to.

RuriGokou,"Been playing over 100 hours now and I still haven't beaten it yet. Elden Ring is really a great game and an excellent step up in the evolution of the Souls series and open world games in general. My only problem with the game so far boils down to these things. * The world is too big* While this is a good thing for some. I'd rather have a world that is smaller but with bigger payoffs for exploration. Elden Ring has that but there were times I'd be exploring not to really find anything of value at all. Only a dead end or some trash mobs. I really liked the first two ""starter"" zones in Elden Ring because it really felt like there was a lot to find if you explored but once I beat the first major story boss, and progressed into the next area those rewards for exploring seemed to be less frequent. With some much to just look around at, it gives me exploration fatigue. *Music* The music is SO bland. Just creepy ambient sounds for the over world, and uninspired boss battle music. Once I left the starter zones I just started putting on podcasts as I played because the music isn't worth listening to. *Quest* This is nitpicking but the quests are just as cryptic as ever. Honestly, gold star to anyone who could have figured out how to finish Ranni's questline without a guide.

granovsp,"My review is for people who knows and likes FS games. Elden Ring is the first game I've preorded. The most important reason why I was hunting for PS5. I'm fun of FromSoftware games. All parts of Souls , Sekiro, BB were finished with big joy. Elden Ring was the game that I was very waiting for. And it's the fist Miyazaki game I've dropped after 65-70% completing. To me: open world for souls game didnt worked . In this time. in Elden Ring I mean. - One of the resaons why I love Souls games it's very good elaboration of locations. it's was always inetersting to expore them. It's like a surviving adventure. But not this time ..Half time of gaming in Elden I'm just moving on ""horse"" throw the big areas. I can just pass throw a lot of enemies. it's not making fun for me. Still I really like some locations like Castles, and Undeground in Capital -> thats a part that reminds me good BB&Souls game with perfect eleboration. And I enjoy them so much. but good locations are limited in quantity. - Some bossess are really nice and hard but they are repeating quite usuall - Due to openworld, extra abilitites and many magical stuff effects on other very imprtant part of the games – *balance* ! And unfortinatly the balance meshed up in ER. It's not broken but it's not as good as usual in FromSoftware games. - And Last thing which is not so important for me still the graphics looks out of date a little. Some locations are good but in general the game looks slightly old fashioned I think it's beacuse of Souls-graphics engine .. Still 60 fps and 4K are ok So to me: Elden Ring is defently overated by Critics. They are some founduemntal things that have to be improved to get reall: 9/10. it's not Zelda BofW (which is one of the best open worlds games) It's not RDR 2. And It's not so interesting as Sekiro / BB / or DS3 Still if you are the player who likes Miyazaki games you will find what them like in Elden Ring but to me it's mixed up fillings. it's not a best project of this great studio but its the biggest. It's good but not perfect as the Mestacritic ratings. to me it's maximum: 7/10",7,2022-05-19,PLAYSTATION 5

willerkiller,If you have not played this game then you're a dumbass. Most amazing and immersive open-world game. Gripping lore that keeps you on edge to learn more. Combat encounters are intricate and an adrenaline rush. Sense of exploration is unmatched. It's a gift from the heavens. Look up above and glimpse the stars. OHHHHHHHHHHH!,10,2022-05-17,PLAYSTATION 5
iMustang,"Elden Ring can best be described as a rollercoaster ****. At moments you're brought to unimaginable highs, and just as quickly it can plummet you to the bottom. The developers certainly set their ambitions high with their first open world game experience, and to give them a lot of points, they hit the mark exceedingly well. Lots of mystery in things to find as you explore, a good deal of freedom in the order in which you complete tasks, and lots of diversity in the various landscapes you encounter along the way. The game is quite simply beautiful; even with unsettling enemies or grotesque environments, there is always a level of charm to be found almost anywhere you look. This ambitious approach was far from perfect however. There's a constant lack of direction throughout the game to an unfortunate fault, as from the beginning you're given a poor idea of where you're supposed to go or what you're supposed to do. While I also love hidden secrets, some tasks you have to do in Elden Ring are exceedingly convoluted. The worst being a key item where you find one half in a relevant area, and the other on the other side of the world hidden in a pot at an unrelated village. Or to finish one quest line you have to find an invisible wall to a cave across the world from where the quest started with no direction. These things simply don't translate well to an open world experience without at least some sense of direction, and it's something I'm hopeful they improve on with the next title. The difficulty of the game will always be a topic of debate, but I must reference that even the director himself apologized that he believes they made the game too difficult even by their own standards. This did leave me unable to play the game by myself and thus I only played with allies. In a way this did create a unique experience I'm glad I had, minus the full month the game's multiplayer way broken, because there was a level of charm in traversing the open world with a party and working together to take down the various challenges before us. Though most of that joy left by the end with the game's highly unbalanced endgame, but if you want more detail on that there are plenty of articles talking about how flawed that was. The rush of finally clearing a difficult boss is at its finest here, but it is a shame so much head bashing is often required to reach it, especially towards the end. The last point of critique is the story. The lore of this world and the characters in it are actually quite amazing, and the cutscenes are beautifully animated and draw you in every time they happen. I do however wish the story was a little more transparent; rather than reading item descriptions or getting tidbits here and there, I wish the story was told to me directly. With cutscenes already so beautiful and stunning, I wish they could have told me about the story I was experiencing as I was already drawn in. Perhaps the maiden could have told me more as I rested at the sites of grace, or Gideon could have talked more in the library? If the creators wrote such a wonderful story they should have held it with pride, not left it to be discovered by independent research. Ultimately the thing I wanted more from this game was transparency. Knowing where to go, what to do, knowledge that weapons matter more than stats (or a better tutorial in general), and of course a better presentation of the story. This lack of transparency in all these factors prevented this game from being a masterpiece to me, but with all that being said, this is still a very good game. Exploring the open world, finding hidden secrets, taking on exciting bosses all with a companion at my side brought a level of charm to this game that captivated me for many nights. If I think of Elden Ring not as a mark of what they've achieved, but rather as a starting point of their new era, I can only get excited. If this is where the starting line is I can only imagine what's around the corner, in fact I firmly believe they can only improve from here. They've nailed so many things perfectly, and if they can refine the lacking components just a little more, I think their next entry could hit a mark of mastery. Elden Ring is a journey worth going on, and while not perfect, definitely delivers a unique adventure with lots of joy to be had. I look forward to what comes next on what is hopefully only the beginning of greater things to come.",8,2022-05-17,PLAYSTATION 5

cronoslegacy,"I wanted to finish the game prior to writing a review and without using online guides but it proved very difficult and ended up googling some progression points to just stop roaming around aimlessly. To start, Elden Ring is a great game by all means and is a nifty throwback to the days when you needed to buy strategy guides and read the instruction booklets that came with games. There is definitely some artificial difficulty here that can be more annoying than fun. Enemies obviously lack stamina gauges and many bosses will just spam you into oblivion with military level missile tracking. some enemies will spam projectiles at you that hardly ever miss and your only chance is i-frame dodging, such is the nature of Souls games. However, here is slightly different as in games past enemies would leave openings for you to exploit, good luck with that here. Most bosses I ended up ""cheesing"" to just get clear. There is a 100% pacifist playthrough that essentially exploits the AI's need to spam you even at it's own detriment. Essentially the player would lure the boss to a cliff of some sort and ""assist"" them on their way off. The funny thing this is seen as a ""challenge"" playthrough when it's actually the most efficient way to defeat the bosses as most of the time you won't be getting within 10ft of the boss without being obliterated by endless AoE attacks. So many times I resulted to spamming rot arrows at a boss from a cliff he couldn't reach (screw you Fallingstar Beast). Then there is the issue of easily missing critical game components. For example, Roderika is a Tarnished you will most likely find semi-early in the game but if you aren't gung-ho about harassing her for dialogue you won't get one of your first ashes AND later at the roundtable a key NPC for making ashes stronger. There is no indication that you need to speak with her multiple times in the slightest. A lot of quests in this game are just like this; easily missed UNLESS you are constantly researching with a google browser open and I feel that's a damn shame. Quests are just so disjointed and NPC's are just so vague when offering help it can be quite annoying more than fun. There are times when you find a riddle and the only way to progress is to talk to another NPC ""merchant"" you met early in the game and since have met about 70 other NPC since, how people figure this nonsense out is beyond me. Other than that, boss battles are generally fairly amazing and the lore is simply amazing. You'll have to piece the story together yourself but it's there. The world is huge and it is amazing fun finding new things constantly. There is a great deal of detail and you can see where the devs put their passion. A good game where ""strategy"" is key and even if the strategy is ""cheesy"" it's still a legit strategy. Remember everything is fair game in war. helpful tips: GET A BOW - I don't care what class you play, bows are awesome and a great tool. You can use them to snipe enemies and lure enemies out of groups and generally have a bigger range than even magic. You can pick up a long bow early from the husks at the roundtable hold for 1000 runes and buy standard arrows from most world merchants fairly cheap. Husk Merchant - located in the roundtable, has some very useful items for sale and inventory expands when you bring Bell Bearings back, some of the most useful ones being Smithing-Stone Miner's Bell Bearing which allows you to buy infinite 1-3 smithing stones and Iji's Bell Bearing for somber smithing stones. There are better ones and ones that allow you to buy higher smithing stones, too! the bells have no other use so make sure to always hand them over to the husk merchants. Exhaust NPC dialogue - just do it, speak to every NPC until they start to repeat themselves. Sometimes later, they will offer helpful advice only if you met the interact prerequisite. Ashes - Use them, they are great and make sure to upgrade them in the roundtable (via Roderika). A good Offense is sometimes the best Defense - Here it's absolutely true. sure, it's great to avoid damage but just defending WILL get you killed. crafting items - so many useful items to craft...namely a cure for poison (which you will be poisoned a lot). You expand your crafting abilities through cookbooks. One that comes to mind is the Armorer's cookbook [2] which you get from the coastal merchant in western Limgrave.",7,2022-05-17,PLAYSTATION 5

The game development was directed by be Souls series father, Mr. Hidetaka Miyazaki and in the creation of the lore was involved the famous fantasy writer Mr. George R. R. Martin. Story / atmosphere: 7/10 Elden ring is a lore driven game, inviting you to discover its world bit by bit, with each inscription read, question asked or simply by sitting on a rock and admiring the surroundings. A contemplative and solemn atmosphere that pervades the whole of Elden Ring that makes you feel lonely in the very best possible way. Unfortunately if the atmosphere manages to convince, the lore does not and fails to meet the expectations of such a great world. Gameplay: 10/10 Elden Ring's gameplay awesome, similar to the other Dark & Demon Souls games unmatched by any other game, with a sense of heft and precision that rewards patience and learning. You can fight on the ground or on horseback where possible which adds a new interesting set of mechanics and approaches. Graphics: 8/10 The graphics manage to create a great and convincing atmosphere, but very often disappoints either with the recycled assents from Dark Souls 3 or the below average animations of the created natural environment which do not fit in an open world game and break the immersion. Sound: 8/10 The sound is pretty minimalistic. At any given moment, there might be a little music in the background as well as the sound of the steady exchange of blows between you and your enemy, but nothing more. Some more effort should have been invested in order to highlight the important progression moments and contribute to the atmosphere of each visited zone. Game functionality and bugs: 8/10 I encountered no issues during my playthough, additionally the game runs awesome on the ps5 but only acceptable on the ps4 with some annoying frame drops from time to time. Value for money: 9/10 The game will definitely give you your money's worth if bought at around 50 - 60 EUR / USD / GBP, providing a nice open world Souls adventure. Conclusion: 8/10 Playing Elden ring is time well spend but it could have been much better with some more love and attention invested in creating a convincing world and setting because sometimes the perfect Souls gameplay formula is not enough in order to make an open game...

jtwain7,"Elden Ring is one of the greatest games ever made. Vast and beautiful open world that offers cool rewards for exploration, deep combat system that allows you to make your own customized build with a HUGE selection of weapons and special weapon arts, wide variety of enemies that will always keep you on your toes as you explore the world, and SO MANY BOSSES that will present the best challenges for you. This game is hard. Do not approach your enemy without understanding that this world wants to KICK YOUR ASS. But as you progress your attributes and your weapons, it is honestly one of the best experiences a game can throw at you. You will feel absolute euphoria when you kill that boss that was destroying you. So, with all that being said, I recommend picking up this game. It’s so refreshing to see that a game lives up to AND exceeds the hype surrounding it. Easily GOTY and I’m here to stand behind it all the way.",10,2022-05-15,PLAYSTATION 5

Ramy230116,"I rarely post negative reviews but I feel like I need to in this instance. I was super excited for this game, I would say it was my most anticipated release of the year and it was the main drive in me purchasing a PS5 before playing. I’m extremely disappointed with it. There is no explanation as how to play, other than minor hints and a short tutorial and these are not enough as it’s quite a complicated. I put hours into researching how to actually play the game before being able to do so, which is not really what you want from a video game where you play to have fun and essentially switch off from real life. A Skyrim type intro would have been better to assist new players in learning the world and it’s dynamics. I’ve put hours and hours into this and feel as though I have gotten nowhere and it’s pretty much got to the stage where I feel like Im forcing myself to carry on playing. I have played the Soul games on PS3/PS4 and enjoyed these (with the exception of Bloodbourne, which I really did not like). Elden Ring, for me, really did not hit the mark. The combat and controls feel clunky and slow, which is not what you expect from a brand new game. You end up getting killed constantly pretty much for this reason. With the controls, it feels like you are playing in 2002 on a PS2 and not 2022 on a PS5. There are bugs (as you would expect), which I normally can overlook (I played Cyberpunk 2077 at launch and still played even though it was buggy as hell) however, I can’t overlook dodges continually not registering in combat and being killed because of this. When you are killed you drop all of the runes you have grinded for (you need runes for upgrading and purchasing) and are out back to wherever the last grace site was. It’s beyond frustrating. There’s no real indication as to where to go, so you are continually walking around lost. Sure, the grace sites point to where you should be going, however, if you miss one you are pretty much on your own and they almost always point towards some boss or other which is pretty much impossible to beat and you end up getting yourself killed or you have to run away and you’re lost again. This was also marketed very much on the fact that George RR Martin was involved in the writing. The sorry is lacklustre, stupidly complicated and nothing special, nothing is explained and you feel like you have no idea what the hell is going on. It really is not something which you would expect the creator game of thrones to have written (although he was involved in writing the final GOT tv series so maybe I should have expected it to be a bit rubbish) The scenery is amazing and it looks just as you would expect a true fantasy game to look, however it was not enough to keep me playing. TLDR: Overhyped, mediocre, complicated for the sake of being complicated, no direction and overall just crap",1,2022-05-15,PLAYSTATION 5

Megazx456,"Elden ring is the combination of everything that from software has been building up since they’re inception! It does away with Many of the traditional modern day gaming troops, time field in game tutorials, and dozens and dozens of hours of pointless handholding throughout majority of the game. From the first moments you step out into the ever expensive and beautiful open world that was Taylor made to be explored from every nook and cranny, you’ll be instantly Smitten by the vast array of ways you can traverse hilltops, mountains caves and other enormous areas fraught with danger! What I truly appreciate the most, is the array of different combat styles the game lets you seamlessly traverse through. Weather being dual welding samurai katanas, Giant great swords, bow and arrows are mystic ancient Staffs to do magic damage Do you enemies from afar, the amount of different character builds one can create is quite endless! The amount of enemies and hidden bosses within the game are quite mind blowing, and there’s no telling where are you stumble upon majority of them as you’re out exploring this beautiful world But the game isn’t without his flaws. The PS5 version I played had A number of technical issues biggest one being pop ins from the grass and foliage. There were a few occasions where I had severe frame rate dips in certain areas within the map which would lead me to restarting the game to help resolve the issue. I’d say one of my minor **** with the game will definitely have to be the cost at trolling players do with placing signs in very tightknit spaces or within chess greatly obscuring the interact item which was quite annoying from time to time. But what else can you expect from a souls like game. Lol All in all, is an amazing game and one that I highly recommend to anyone who May have had a passing fancy interest within souls light games. This is definitely the one that I highly recommend you start with first. And don’t let the talks of it being a very difficult game swear you, bear through it learn from your mistakes and persevere through and you’ll find a true diamond in the rough with this modern day classic! 9/10",9,2022-05-14,PLAYSTATION 5

joel_tdl,"No un Mal Juego, Pero Ni de Broma una Obra Maestra JUGABILIDAD: Lo primero que tengo que decir es que, al tratarse de un juego en mundo abierto, se agradece tener el viaje rápido desde el primer momento. Y considerando lo poco interesante que me ha parecido el mundo de Elden Ring, y que no he disfrutado mucho de andar cabalgando por ahí, es un premio doble. Pero quiero explicar lo anterior. El juego pretende obligar al jugador a hacer una exploración completa del mapa para ir descubriendo cosillas, y eso va de gustos a gustos, pero a mi en lo personal no me termina de convencer. La principal razón es la nula narrativa (y es que, por favor, no nos engañemos) que lo hace poco atractivo para mí. Además, la tan hablada capacidad de saltar es prácticamente inútil: no tiene ninguna utilidad práctica. De hecho, he usado y disfrutado mucho más de la capacidad de agacharse que del salto. Yo he disfrutado mucho más de las zonas interiores como los Castillos, que de este mundo abierto, aunque por otro lado, la mitad de esas zonas son un descarado copy-paste de lo ya visto en Bloodborne (claro que tal vez por eso me gustaron). Hablando propiamente de la jugabilidad, es OBLIGATORIO decir que es inconcebible que la magia esté desbalanceada de nuevo. A mí me gusta jugar con Destreza + Magia y no dejare de hacerlo y divertirme solo porque el estudio cometió el error de darle mucho poder a los hechizos (Otra vez, ejem ejem DS, DS1). La fijación de enemigos no funciona como debería. No siempre fija al enemigo más cercano, ni al que dirigimos la cámara, ni al más fuerte. Es como si fuese algo meramente al azar y, en más de una vez, me pasó que no me dejaba cambiar de oponente. Eso es especialmente frustrante cuando hay algún animal cerca de la hora de enemigos, y el juego fija únicamente a ese inofensivo animal. Además, la inteligencia artificial tampoco es precisa, puedes estar golpeando a un enemigo entre otros 10, y ni siquiera van a voltearte a ver (de verdad, y literalmente te ignoran, aunque estés a dos pasos de ellos atacando a sus compañeros). Y llegamos a los más importante… Los bosses no son para nada complicados (salvo un par de ellos ya carca del final), y basta con un par de intentos para vencerlos a todos, cosa que rara vez me pasaba en los anteriores juegos del desarrollador. Hay dificultad artificial: bosses gigantescos metidos en arenas muy pequeñas, y bosses literalmente invisibles. Pero eso no es la dificultad real que a mí me gusta jugar. Contra un jefe en específico me pasó que desapareció del mapa a los segundos de empezar la batalla, y me quedé atrapado en su sala. Un par de minutos después el jefe mágicamente murió y me dieron el gane. Cosas como esa matan totalmente la diversión porque ya es un Boss contra el que yo no pude pelear. Las invocaciones de ceniza me gustan, y son perfectas para quienes no pueden o no quieren jugar en línea, bien ahí FS. Tenemos también las típicas misiones de personajes que son imposibles de seguir sin usar guías, y que la nula narrativa no ayuda a sobrellevar. Y por lo demás tenemos el típico Contenido Artificial ya conocido en la empresa: misma mazmorra, con mismos enemigos y mismos jefes. Y no precisamente dos ni tres veces. De verdad, los Jefes se repiten MUCHO. Y que “raro” que eso no le restara puntos como sí pasó con Nioh en prácticamente todas las reviews… GRÁFICOS: Por debajo de la media, incluso para un mundo abierto. El estudio desarrollador nos tiene ya acostumbrados a entregar un apartado visual que cumple a duras penas. La interacción es mínima y reciclada, y el diseño artístico tampoco sorprende en exceso y las cinemáticas… ¿cuáles cinemáticas? Las pocas que hay no sorprenden en absoluto, vamos que veníamos de un DS3 y ER logra, de alguna forma, hacerlo peor. Por si fuera poco, el juego tiene un popping espantoso. SONIDO: Yo no veo el soundtrack Épico del que tanto se hablaba, pero por ningún lado. Muy por debajo a Bloodborne o Dark Souls 3, sin mencionar que los efectos parecen (y probablemente sean) reciclados de estos. No es malo pero, de nuevo, cumple a duras penas. INNOVACIÓN: No importa cómo se haya vendido el juego, su innovación es mínima rayado en lo nulo. Vemos enemigos reciclados, con los mismos movesets y efectos de estado que en DS3, solo que con un lavado de cara para que visualmente sean un poco distintos (y eso muy a duras penas, otra vez). Gente, por favor no se engañen a sí mismos: cambiarles el NOMBRE a los iconos de un juego de 2016 y ponerlos en un juego de 2022 NO es innovar. Es un Dark Souls 3 en mundo abierto.",8,2022-05-13,PLAYSTATION 5

regixjuggler,"The game is addicting and has good collection loops.

Blue9710x,"Elden Ring blew my expectations sky high. I am currently about 120 hours into Elden Ring and am still finding caves and bosses I haven't even seen before. I have completed most character side quests and have beat almost every major boss in the game but I can't wait to explore the Lands Between all over again with a new build in new game plus. Exploring the world of Elden Ring has been such a blast. The game is absolutely massive without feeling empty. I couldn't go five minutes without finding something cool or interesting in the world. The environmental design and art direction for every area, npc, armor, weapon, spell, and boss is outstanding. The lore and story of Elden Ring always peeked my interest and made me want to look through every item description to learn more about the world. There are some very memorable side quests and moments that I don't think I will ever forget. Some of the bosses in Elden Ring are among the best I've ever fought. Nearly everything about Elden Ring feels handcrafted to perfection. The only problems I have with the game are that there are a lot of repeat bosses and many bosses or enemies have extremely hard to dodge attacks that insta kill anyone with a low enough vigor. Also the game has some problems that are hard to avoid due to its scale, like how its hard to know how to continue a side quest without a guide and some of the repeat bosses feel poorly placed. But these problems are relatively small because the rest of the game is genuinely amazing. Overall, I think Elden Ring might be my favorite game of all time but I need some more time to fully decide that. Also anyone who is new or hasn't played a soulsborne game should play try Elden Ring before other soulsborne games due to the massive access ability the game lends to players. But one thing that is for sure is I will definitely be picking up every fromsoftware title I haven't played yet (Dark Souls 1-3 and Sekiro) and I will be getting the platinum trophy for Elden Ring. I can't wait for the dlc.",10,2022-05-12,PLAYSTATION 5
Jusso,"Un mundo abierto diferente, Incita bastante a la exploración sin llevarte de la mano y la recompensa bastante bien ya qué hay objetos útiles escondidos y algunos jefes secretos secretos que son espectaculares. El combate está bastante pulido y apartado artístico que ,aunque, se siente que es un motor gráfico obsoleto es simplemente hermoso. La evolución lógica de la fórmula Souls. Tendrá algunos fallos como que se extiende la duración artificialmente poniendo jefes repetidos y después de muchas horas puede llegar a ser algo repetitivo aunque después el juego te sorprende y se pasa, entre otros fallos minúsculos que no demeritan lo bueno.",10,2022-05-12,PLAYSTATION 5

ScoresAreBad,"Elden Ring is a great game and the open world definitely brings a new sense of adventure to the souls formula. That being said. As someone who has played all soulsborne games. I'm pretty neutral towards Elden Ring. The game is good and the open world, especially on the first playthrough, is breathtaking and freeing. But with the open world the challenge and carefully crafted skillcurve has completely vanished. The game starts hard, becomes extremely easy, and gets unfairly hard at the end. I've beaten the game 5 times now and spent more than 200 hours with the game, so you'll definitely get your value. But as a package this game feels to me like the weakest of all Soulsborne games. Please fix the skillcurve or go back to linearity again. Pros: - Sense of adventure - Big world - Many bosses - So many gameplay choices! - Horsey - Pot Friend - Great questlines and legacy dungeons (including their bosses) Cons: - Underwhelming overworld bosses - Horrible skillcurve - So many dungeons not worth exploring - Godskin Duo can **** it",7,2022-05-12,PLAYSTATION 5

on3st4b,"I've put in ~30h+ the time i'm writing this review. I have the PS5 version, running on performance mode, had no issues, slowdowns till now. A major issue with the game and gaming community is the ratings this game is getting.. 100 by ""critics"" is just stupid! don't get me wrong, it is a good game but nowhere near 100, and it can certainly greatly improve in several aspects. The Good : - Challenging game-play - Open world - you can go anywhere from the get go - Character & gear progression - Lots of weapons and armors to choose from - Lots of areas to search The Bad : - The AI is dog **** - you can assassinate a guard and hide, then another guard will pass by and not get alarmed or anything... i guess he thinks his buddy is sleeping or something. - No story tracking mechanism - In your adventures you will encounter a lot of npc, most of them have a story or quest for you. There is no mechanism that tracks that, some kind of journal with the npc name and the dialogue ( FFS ) even simple notes. - The story is like a cheap LOTR knock off Some points potential buyer should be aware of : Its a Souls game - thus its difficult Be prepared to die a lot, its part of the game. Some ""farming"" is required It doesn't hold your hand like most games, you will need to explore a lot. You will die a lot No idea how critics review this a 100, i really don't .. They must be some sort of Souls hardcore fans, but even fans should be able to point out that something is wrong and needs fixing.

ShadoWraith,"I guess you could say that this is a Dark Souls meets an inferior version of Skyrim. The graphics and far from being next gen (I find the comparisons on this with Forbidden West hilarious). Frame rate ****. It's just another game that's hard for the sake of being hard leaving out a huge subset of players whereas Horizon Forbidden West gives the player a choice. If you love your game to be cheap and very difficult overall then you can have that. If you are just a casual player then there is that two and for everyone in between. Elden Ring? Nope. The big area of controversy lately has been between those who don't want much **** and those who want something like Witcher 3. Here again, Forbidden West gives you flexibility in choosing between a very detailed GUI to off when one doesn't want one or need it. This is very old school in everything from difficulty, graphics, game play, GUI and innovativeness (or lack thereof). In Forbidden West the graphics are photo-realistic, you don't feel isolated, it has more of a plot and the game play gives a wide range of different types. With that being said, if you love the Dark Souls type of games and/or retro games this is for you. Everyone else, good luck. You're going to at least being wanting to rage quite fairly often.",4,2022-05-10,PLAYSTATION 5
Smisswiss,"Tying coop with pvp is one of the most brain dead decisions to an otherwise excellent game. Some continuously argue that ""it's part of the experience"" or ""just get good"", it goes against the very fabric of the core gameplay which is play your way or play your build. PvE has always allowed for greater freedom in viable builds, while some builds are less efficient and others more, it doesn't truly matter as practicially any build will work throughout the entire game. PvP on the other hand is by nature an exercise in group intelligence. in PvP people quickly filter down to what works best and what works quickest. What this translates to, is a jarring difference in how the game plays out when youre PvPing or PvEing. So that comes back to my original complaint, that a forced invasion when you're playing with friends, turns a rather chill or relaxed exploration game, into yet another PvP meta game. If you don't run the cheese builds, or know of every explotative environmental advantage, then tough luck, you'll have to start all over again.",2,2022-05-10,PLAYSTATION 5
StoneCold_ET_,"An incredible achievement that brings Souls games into an open-world.

The graphics are pitiful for a super ""AAA""game,Demon Souls has 10 times better graphics.Those repetitive bosses, a long world, big but useless.

TRVOR,"Most people have given this game a 10/10, which I can agree with, up to a point. The good: - The map is huge and varied - the enemies are all beautifully designed and are well animated - the game's difficulty, paired with the high map allows for ""if you struggling in one place, give up a go some else"", simply brilliant - the combat is oh so very satisfying once you find the right play style - ""most"" of the bosses are challenging but possible to defeat after you've given them a few hundred goes. - the story (while of course being very vague) is interesting and once you get down to it, have the good old George R.R. Martin spice that he applied to The Song of Ice and Fire books. The Bad: - a few bosses are bloody awful, there's one near the end of the game that is so poorly thought out you'd think the developers were playing a joke on you which you can't even laugh at the cause of how un-fun it was to fight this, and this wouldn't that bad if you could just ignore it and go somewhere else, but you have to defeat this boss in order to finish the game, so I'm sitting here thinking ""F--- you FromSoftware"" bash my head in every time I die. All and all, I am extremely happy I played this game despite the many times it beat me down, I will never forget the way I finished it, the final boss had me are 10% health, and I had no way to heal myself, so I just thought ""F--- it"" and hammered away at its health, perfectly dodging every attack, it eventually got to the point where we were both one hit away from killing each other, it tried to grab me, but I dodged through it and killed it, and the feeling I got from that moment is something I will never forget.

neufeldr33,"Un juego enorme, con la virtud de dar al jugador una gran libertad de como llevar su partida; con incontables secretos, armas, armaduras, que personalizan la aventura y la hacen única. Grandes ideas que ya al momento de jugar se van desvaneciendo, el combate es injusto, no en el sentido de que sea difícil, si no eso, injusto, abusan del instant kill, jefes con vida casi ilimitada, que en lugar de generar la sensación de aprender, como en otros souls, frustran, ya que siempre estás al alcance de que con un golpe te maten. El mapa es inmenso, pero se siente sumamente vacío, la gran mayoria de los enemigos puedes elegir pasarlos de largo, no hay gran cantidad de NPCs, hay peleas memorables, pero muchos jefes se repiten, en realidad no creo que pase de 10 los jefes realmente memorables y únicos. Creo que quisieron hacer un juego inmenso, y lo hicieron, pero esa inmensidad no necesariamente es una virtud, la moda actual es que mientras más haya que hacer en un juego o más hora dure es mejor y eso le pasa a Elden Ring, pudo ser un juego más concreto y ser una mejor experiencia",7,2022-05-09,PLAYSTATION 5

Egis511,"This is the weakest souls game in my opinion. Yes, its the biggest of them **** yes it is...well that is probably all. The size of the game means you will run from place to place longer, but that does not make it any more interesting as game does not reward you for your exploration. You will find hidden dungeons and caves, but the rewards of completing them are meaningless and most of the time useless. Items you receive in early game are superior to items from later areas. Balance is appoling. Spells you get with a starting character are better than 90 percent of all the spells you will find in the game later. Weapon upgrades make no sense as to upgrade regular weapon is more expensive and tedious than boss/exotic weapons. Game is buggy. Lost millions of souls because the game decided to bug out on me. Enemies hitting you through the walls, game favours particular style of playing (bleeding, sorcery etc.). Boss fights are designed poorly by all difficulty being almost non existing windows when you can hit npc. Weapons have combos what you will never gonna use on boss as there won't be window big enough to finish it. However, it is still better game than most of crap that was released in the last few years.

O_DuckiO_o,I loved this game when it first came out but every single update has made me want a refund. They've made so your mount will run forward just by being on it. Spells will target directly into the floor; they've booster enemies coding to react to controller actions predicting player movements. I get that part of the appeal is supposed to be the randomized structure of the same move behaving several ways but it being based off camera angles means you will use the same move 3 times and sometimes they will go 3 times the distance and sometimes they simply work only directly in front of you.

IamBeanhead,"This games world is enormous and filled with things to do. The beautiful design and lore of this game is remarkable and each location you reach seems to tell a story in itself. Enemy design is unparalleled. Fantastic music and sound. Combat is smooth and there is tons of different builds to play with. The absence of a quest log fits so well with this game. Allows you to adventure, how you’re supposed to, and explore yourself without dozens of waypoints and markers. It keeps you immersed in the world. I’m constantly in awe of how beautiful some of the locations look and even some of the enemy designs. The game is very accessible. Yes it’s a hard game but you can make it easier if you want. Farming runes to over level every enemy you come across and certain builds make some bosses seem like a joke. But you can play how you want. That’s what makes the game very enjoyable for me. It’s easier than most souls games but not because the actual enemies and bosses are easier but because of the amount of different tools and ways you can come at these enemies. You can also just walk away, level up, and come back later. The difficulty is masterfully balanced. If you have been wanting to jump into the Souls series, this is the game to do it. Don’t let the difficulty scare you from this masterpiece ****. If you are stuck or need help with what builds you can use, there are plenty of guides out there. You can also use summons to make fights easier and take some pressure off of you. It’s the most accessible Souls game. Play it. You will not regret it.",10,2022-05-08,PLAYSTATION 5
zach_grech,One of the best Open-world games ever. Build customisation and NPC quest lines are the best in the series. This game manages to do so many things so well. The legacy dungeons are all excellent with some of the best bosses in the series. Dungeons around the world have some great puzzles and level design however enemies are often overused.

Jiggyshiggy,I never played dark souls series. Elden ring is my first. I have to say. It’s great game. But the open world doesn’t suit elden ring. Sure it’s fun to discover some things. Don’t get me wrong. I’m not saying give me smaller maps. Why is this game full of bosses. Im glad we get way more than expected. Most games are half of content. And the rest with micro transactions…. Anyway I’m at NG+5 I already defeated elden beast 4 times. Around 200 hours In the game. First I was confused what to do. Im not that stupid. But there is literally no guide to see where u have to go. I guarantee everyone in elden ring search YouTube or googles it. Where to go after the first site of grace. I don’t wanna look on YouTube or google it. But this game made me do it. I like a challenging game. But I don’t wanna die like 100 times ( talking about first play through ) after the end game. It felt like it’s done. Why go to NG+. Yea maybe we mist a quest then u can do it again from there. Anyway. After ng+2.. I was farming a lot of runes. Also side bosses… then I just went for main bosses. That’s it. Didn’t care about anything else anymore. It feels really boring…. No hate. My score was first 9/10. But now after ng+5. It drops down to 5/10 Btw.. after patch update in late April. On PS5 it feels slower when I do combo sword attacks. My stamina gain slower aswell. Try rivers of blood katana. Use the blood skill. Then u will see what I mean. ** My final score is 5/10. ** What a shame. I really liked this game. But going back now. Why would I? Multiplayer coop. Takes forever for someone to summon me. I already defeated the boss. I wait for someone else request my help. But then it takes ages. I had to wait 15 mins. I just cancelled it. Go to ng+ again cuz there is nothing to do. All the bosses I defeated are gone I give another try if we ever get a DLC. But for now. No thanks.,5,2022-05-05,PLAYSTATION 5

goglike,"Contrary to most reviewers, I loved the open world and spent 180 hours in this game. After that time one might think I would leave at least mixed review but unfortunately late game has displayed too many problems and I have to put negative review now. I played every souls game starting from demon souls. For me what was very important in every souls game is combat mechanics, that is the only thing that truly (gameplay-wise) separates souls game from any slasher-type game. Mechanics like where one has to commit to attack, because there is no way to cancel its animation, mechanics when weapons get stuck in the wall, different move sets of different weapons, etc. All these mechanics got basically destroyed by introducing customizable ashes of war and posture system. Ash of war is a skill that you attach to the weapon and can use while bearing that weapon. The problem with them is that contrary to the weapon balance these things are absolutely unbalanced. This is obviously clearly visible in the late game, as the difficulty ramps up at some point you have to either oneshot-twoshot enemy with your weapon art or commit to long battle using regular attacks. I have a faith build so couple of examples with my build would be: 1) Blasphemous blade. Regular attacks hit for 300-500, weapon art hits for 1200+ in AOE and heals you 20% for every enemy hit. What is the point to use anything but these ashes of war in combat? 2) Godslayer blade. This one bad boy just deals straight up to 3000+ dmg to enemy, while normal hits are in the area of 400-600. Its not aoe, so it is not always usable, but when it is - there is no point in using anything else. 3) Any other weapon. The best ashes of war for my build would be incredible flames of the Redmane. This bad boy staggers any enemy in the game in couple of hits. On top of that, the HARDEST hitting spells in my arsenal such as flame take thee will hit for about 1000-1300. So these ashes of war make not only weapons, but also MOST of the spells redundant. What is the point in parrying enemy if you can just get them into posture break with flame of the redmanes? What is the point of dodging if you could use bloodhound step instead? Basically, From Software took all mechanics that made their games great and just tossed them all out of the window with unbalanced, absolutely over tuned ashes of war. What's worse, there are very few ashes of war that are actually interesting to use, most of them is just ONE BIG HUGE HIT IN AOE. For example, there are very few ashes of war that would allow you to somehow better your positioning and they are locked behind unique weapons. So if you imagine how you would wield two curved swords and jump around with ashes of war to keep distance from enemies - forget that, you are not getting it. What you could get though is a HUGE BIG HIT IN AOE, enjoy. Second thing I mentioned was posture break. This thing is also terribly over tuned on several types of attack. These are guard breaks and jump attacks. When you wield two heavy weapons there are no point in doing anything but jump attacks. If you wield one heavy weapon, fastest way to defeat enemy would be spam guard breaks. That's it, there is no more depth to the game. I really do not like the directions these games are going and as a big fan it is incredibly disappointing. Even games like Assassins Creed which are often used as an example of lazy game development now have more in-depth combat than famous souls series and this it is utterly disappointing.",3,2022-05-05,PLAYSTATION 5

ihearthawthats,"Hours Played: 300+ Hours (still playing) Trophy Completion: 42/42 PLATINUM Worth My Time: Yes, easily a 500+ hour game. Worth My Money: Yes, you definitely get your money's worth. What I Like: It's the souls formula in an open world and it works well. So if you enjoy both genres like me, then you're in for a treat. Mostly a familiar trek to those experienced, but adds just enough variety and new stuff to keep things interesting. What I Dislike: It's a PS4 (PRO) game through and through. Nothing is being taken advantage of specifically in the PS5 hardware. In fact, the performance can be quite subpar at times. Magic is OP in both PVE and PVP in this game. Great if you like magic, **** if you don't. How It Stacks Up: I still prefer the Dark Souls series. This game does some great things, but it also falls short in some aspects. Assets are reused quite a bit, despite the core gameplay being addictive. PVP is in a bit of a sorry state right now unless you use magic. Difficulty is more forgiving due to lots of checkpoints and less severe death penalties, but the game is still long and treacherous. It's a must play.",9,2022-05-04,PLAYSTATION 5

Mehrunes,"Amazing game. Everything about it is just perfect. The gameplay is fun and exhilarating and the world is fun to explore and packed with things to find. It's also probably one of the prettiest games I've ever played. The spells look amazing. It has that classic From Software feeling put dialed up to 10. However, the horse is kinda buggy sometimes, but I've rarely had problems with that, especially after the recent patches. I also feel like the crypts get tedious because they are all kinda the same. But there's dogs-I mean, turtles. In short 10/10. Must play",10,2022-05-04,PLAYSTATION 5
OliBoboli0815,"Elden Ring - A huge world filled with filler content. For me the game was ok, but not more. I really liked the huge variety of weapons and ashes of war that enable a huge variety of playstyles. What really bothered me is the low variety of bosses and their quality. A lot of the non-story bosses feel not very well designed and are repeated too often, e.g. the tree avatars that are the asylum demon from Dark Souls I with an AoE attack. Quite some bosses also appear to have infinite stamina, which turn the fights into dodge spamming. Unless you have upgraded your spirit ashes and summon them. Then a lot of fights become trivial. The legacy dungeons are top notch, but the smaller dungeons / places often feel like a cheaper version of souls games. Overall, the quality of most areas and bosses seems to have suffered strongly from the sheer size of the world. For me this results in a game world that is filled with filler content.",5,2022-05-03,PLAYSTATION 5
average-reviewr,"It was a souls maserpiece. The bosses were intimidating and the performance was good but not great. The story was good as always, like the hidden statue and walls.

Sleckers,"Incredible game. I was a soul's noob when I started this game and have only now stopped playing to conquer all soul's games I can find. I played a small bit of this game prior to purchasing it and fell in love within an hour, the difficulty was there but it never felt unrealistic or cheap. Each death left me confident I could improve either my tactic or play style before rushing back in to take another attempt. Prior to this game, I attempted a few souls games such as Bloodborne but never liked some of the features (long runs back, lack of guidance, road blocks of ""git good"" or you can't proceed) but the open world nature of Elden Ring and some other quality of life improvements have negated these issues and produced not just an amazing game for me, but one that has opened my eyes to the entire soul's series. The world itself is large and sprawling but finding something to do feels very organic, no longer am I ticking off map marker locations but instead, I am stumbling accross interesting places to visit. Events such as running away from a group of mobs to find a crypt or opening a chest and finding more than I bargained for were all extremelty exciting experiences and I have fond memories of this game. The feeling of satisfaction when you defeat a hard enemy is amazing with this game, I haven't played a game like this where I have been stuck, strugling and banging my head against a wall only to keep going with a smile on my face since the 90's. One of my all time fav games.",10,2022-05-03,PLAYSTATION 5

I'm amazed as a game dev and as a player. The work done is brilliant, it’s incredible. The Art direction, the background of each faction, the mood of desperation gluing everything together.

RaidanX,"As a new souls player I was like many other players apprehensive about purchasing the game. The first 6 hours were tough but vital for the rest of my adventure in the lands between. I died many times and didn’t gain any runes but I did enjoy the exploration and eventually I gained the satisfaction of killing a boss and some difficult enemies. After these 6 hours I experienced without doubt the greatest game I have ever played (2nd isn’t even close by the way). I’ve spent around 160 hours in the game and will be completing multiple playthroughs. Fantastic world design, exploration, multiple armor sets, weapons, skills, varied enemy design and some fantastic boss fights. My warning to new players is the game does not hold your hand and will not give you a clear path. You will have to explore and pay attention to the the dialogue for little clues and lore. If side quests interest you then you will need a guide. Some of the side quests are excellent and full of lore but easy to fail or get lost. I know some won’t like doing this but the lore, boss fights and rewards make it worth doing. I’m at the end of my first playthrough and have just defeated the hardest boss (optional) and already planning my next one. 10/10 Insane rating",10,2022-05-02,PLAYSTATION 5

drlowdon,"Over the past decade FromSoftware have built a reputation as one of the most reliable developers around, and they’ve continued that form with The Elden Ring. In gameplay terms it retains much of the formula laid down by previous Dark Souls titles with players developing their characters to use melee weapons, magic or a mixture of both. The game is punishing, and it’s very easy to die, but the combat is incredibly satisfying and rarely feels unfair, especially since checkpoints are found more frequently than before. The biggest change is that, for the first time, FromSoftware have created a true open world. There was a concern that this could be to the games detriment, as the intricate world design has always been a huge part of what made their games so great, but “The Lands Between” are just incredible to explore. Unlike so many other games in the genre there isn’t an endless list of quests to complete, or icons to make your way towards, instead players are left to find the world’s secrets for themselves. And there are secrets to be found everywhere! If I was going to point out one negative it’d be the fact that many of the dungeons/catacombs play a little too similar, but that is just a small nitpick in what is a truly amazing game.",9,2022-05-01,PLAYSTATION 5

Unfortunately the gaming community seems to be controlled now by the 'Youtube commentators', they randomly choose a game to like and then we're all meant to be gushing about how in love we are with it. It has ugly graphics and ugly game mechanics. NPC's walk these pathetic linear paths 5 minutes after you've killed them, how does that make an immersive game? It's brutally difficult forcing a massive grind, the UI is ugly and not optimised for PC at all..... It's a horrible experience and It will sink in popularity as quickly as it rose. What makes me even more angrier is people slate AC games for changing their mechanics but praise this game when the mechanics in new AC games are quite similar; leveling, gear acquistion, and boss fights... The difference is the animations for fighting and overal experience is dynamic and fluid... Elden ring is just clunky and repetitive. I hate it.

Ruff_Ambassador,Never played a dark souls game but this is easily one of the best games I’ve ever had the pleasure of playing. The world is so huge and expansive and the difficulty is basically optional based on the weapons and build you give your self so if your stuck on a boss or a certain area just go somewhere else and level up or find a sick new weapon to destroy everything with in the ginormous map. The only problems I have with the game is sometimes the controller would be unresponsive but it was very rare and that when you lock on to an enemy the game can just randomly lock you on to another enemy if you look in there direction which is very annoying in the heat of battle but you get used to it.,9,2022-04-29,PLAYSTATION 5

However the grind is well worth the experience, the maps and open world is interesting and the exploration is very satisfying, it no linear and it can be a bit daunting , but being patient and levelling up and getting more skills and spells open up the game. The game is simply fantastic. You can keep playing hours and hours, honestly is one of those epic legendary games that will be reference for years to come. Cant praise it high enough.

The amount of stuff that is in the map is amazing, I used to really love FarCry 3, but could not finish FC4 and any assassins creed since brotherhood, even though I thought I loved open world, it is until now I realise I miss the feelings of discovery, of things that are genuinely different, and that the environment, the enemy placement and items tell a story to those who seek it.

Some people complain about the difficulty of a boss and you are like ""what? I first tried it"" and at another boss you have been struggling at some people got through with ease. The world looks beautiful, the lore is interesting even though not much is said and this game is just so much fun it's crazy. I never had that much fun in a souls game.

I_Am_Legacy,"Having an absolute blast with Elden Ring, I've got about 20-30 hours in so far and still plenty of content left to do, they definitely improved on the Dark Souls formula I'm surprised the user scores aren't in the high 8's at least. The PS5 games I have played so far have been underwhelming even with the increased power of the PS5 games seem to fall short as developers continue to push for graphics, how many realistic shadows they can render and more prettier lights instead of focusing on what matters which is solid framerate at a steady resolution which I am glad to say Elden Ring does perfectly and there are hardly any framerate dips in performance mode. This game isn't for everyone, if you have never played a souls game before ( Dark Souls, Bloodborne etc. ) you will find this game very hard, it is supposed to be hard it's not because you are bad, there is a steep learning curve and you need the patience to potentially run against a boss 100 times before you beat them, learn the mechanics, learn how to switch quickly between defensive and aggressive playstyles. This game is a 10/10 for me either because it is genuinely that good or because industry standards of what constitutes a good game have dropped so low lately Elden Ring outshines anything which releases today as it is a solid fun experience without the live service predatory monetisation schemes and the infuriating grindfest season passes which companies like EA and TakeTwo mandate in all of their game releases, Elden Ring is a game you pay for and you come home with a game and not a project to be fixed later down the line.",10,2022-04-27,PLAYSTATION 5

Toyaflo,"GOTY EASY unless Valve decides to drop Portal 3 Outta nowhere I don't see how anything beats it. One of the major elements that makes this game so incredible is it's open world. The open world doesn't feel forced like many games but feels like a natural evolution of dark souls. A problem I have with open world games is how many times story telling is done through dialogue. This isn't bad but is quite a lazy and forceful way to approach world development. Dark Souls has the habit of letting it's world speak for itself and that aspect of dark souls compliments an open world design. Elden ring also has a plethora of weapons to experiment with and build your character around. The element of respec ing brought in from Dark Souls 2 allows you to experiment with your build. The enemy variety in this game is off the charts although plenty of bosses are reused. It can get tedious to fight the same boss again with only minor changes but all of the repeated bosses are optional and something you mainly just fight for better loot so you can fight other harder bosses more easily. There are a few late game bosses with are overly aggressive but 2-3 hours for frustration in no way sours the hundreds of hours of enjoyment you have in this game. The main quest is quite straightforward and easy to follow but some side quests will require you to go really out of your way to complete which is something a lot of people might not like but a counterpoint to that is these quests enhance the sense of discovery like no other game does. If there was a straight line pointing you to all the right places the open world would lose a lot of it's meaning. I don't want to talk about the graphics of this game as there are the beta cucks that complain about them whenever a single ray of light doesn't bounce of their character's **** at the right angle but it's safe to say that Elden ring is a beautiful game and it's art direction is out of this world that more than makes up for it's graphics which are already pretty good. The only thing I can complain about is maybe the multiplayer, dark souls has never had a good history with multiplayer although the net code is better than it's previous games it's right now far from ideal and a few balancing issues plague the game as well as certain weapons that are fun to use in single player aren't very fun used against you in multiplayer, it is a minor gripe however something I've learnt to let slide as the souls community when it comes to multiplayer is very good and sometimes the toxic parts can be fun. If you are a souls fan you are guaranteed to love this and if you aren't this game will definitely make you want to go back and try out their other titles (I recommend bloodborne it's my personal favourite). This game is definitely a masterpiece and has me looking at Fromsoftware with eager eyes to see what they come up with next as it will has big shoes to fill.",10,2022-04-24,PLAYSTATION 5

maxikq,"I'm a souls veteran who finished all games multiple times, spent around 1000h in total playing FromSoftware games, 150h in Elden Ring, and I couldn't figure out why there is so much hype about this game which is clearly the worst of all souls-games (besides DS2). Now I think I figured it out. FromSoftware told people that Elden Ring is not Dark Souls and it is more accessible to regular players. Both information is a lie obviously because Elden Ring IS Dark Souls 3.5 and IS much more difficult than other souls because of bad boss fights balance, bad locations balance, and unhandled balancing issues caused by open world. Therefore, my guess is that people giving 10/10 are mostly new players in the genre who have experienced the souls game for the first time and obviously any souls game will give you this amazing feeling of accomplishment. Even though Elden Ring is the worst of all FromSoftware games in terms of lore, performance, balance, dialogs, and boss design. So they give 10/10 to the game that is different than anything they previously experienced, not knowing that this is not the best the genre offers :). Btw. Elden Ring has the worst user reviews score from all souls games on Metacritic. I guess soon Elden Ring players will play other FS games like Bloodborne and will realize that Elden Ring is not the best souls game :) then reviews will be updated.",6,2022-04-23,PLAYSTATION 5

In a few words its a great game Looking it objectively and truly playing and learning how to explore without spoon feed information for the quest will make you want to play more, there's people that complains about the dificulty but that just make it much more rewarding when you achieve your objectively or defeat a boss that took you many tries.

Rallen4520,"Open world not so open, clunky combat and controls. Go from point to point hoping not to have to maneuver around the god awful cliffs, only to find out the world isn’t so open. You can’t just go anywhere, there is roadblocks from area to area with the occasional workaround to get into the area. The targeting lock is horrid, boss fight will frustrate you as you have to continue to run, dodge or block, most of the time will be spent spinning around trying to get a lock on just to spin forward because you can see the boss but the targeting system is designed to turn you 180 degrees if you miss the lock. Can’t use your map while freely roaming if an enemy has seen you, it doesn’t matter where he is, you will be forced to wait it out to use the map. Torrent is a gimped horse who turns like an 18 wheeler, however the game has instances where you have to use torrent to navigate the horrendous cliff system. The game is the easiest of the dark souls, game mechanics severely hurt this game, “git gud” means memorizing the path over and over and dealing with game controls. The bosses are scripted and ignore anything you do. The environment is a visual and nothing more, bosses ignore it. The target lock system is random and will have you targeting behind the guy about to bash your face in. Two guys running at you and a third stays back out of range and the lock on will select him, if not him it will be a random deer. Anything but the guy directly in front of you. Mechanics kill the fun. There is no coop multiplayer, it’s a pvp invite, even when using a password. Goty? Nope…this belongs in the trash. Metacritic reviews are junk.",5,2022-04-22,PLAYSTATION 5

Shojikibouzu,"Short review: I imagine you will like this game if your favorite movies are thrillers or horror movies. However, mine are not, so I just thought it was ok. I recognize it as a masterpiece of its genre, but it is far from my favorite game. Long review: There is plenty of lore (backstory), but the gameworld is a broken and unattractive place, devoid of any viable communities that could theoretically rebuild the world. I never felt a sense of wonder or desire to be a part of the world being depicted, and not once did I fantasize about living or being in the lands between (the gameworld), which I do in the best games I play. At best I felt curious about how the place became so miserable, but that's about it. I was also never drawn in to the story by a desire to become Elden Lord. The closest thing to a community I found in the game was a crazy group of culty enemies, so why would I want to rule such a place? Since the game is just about killing basically everything, it would have made more sense if the game was a story about revenge. At least then perhaps I would have felt some motivation to kill things (other than disgust at their gross appearances). The game's exploration if fun, and I like the lack of objective markers everywhere. However, I wasn't exploring for the love of the world (everything is too dark and disgusting for that), it was just out of a desire to find the rare item that would help my build so I don't die as much. The first 10-15 hours or were much better (limgrave and the weeping peninsula), when I still experimenting and trying to settle on a build, but after that the game became increasingly tedious. Boss fights can be thrilling, and beating bosses can give you jolts of adrenaline and excitement. If that's what you like then this game is for you. If you like experimenting with combat builds then this game might also be for you. If you can, try playing at a friend's house before buying.",7,2022-04-22,PLAYSTATION 5
Dnilo,"I'm not going deep into what everyone already knows, this game is good but not great. Instead I will point out the Good and the Bad about it. If you expect the challenge of any other SoulsBorne game you are in for disappointment, and I'm not referring to how hard it can be with bosses and enemies, no. It is about the way you ""fight"" in this game. Use of magic is forced into ANY build now, so there is no 'DEX' build anymore, which on other Souls games was also called the 'challenge' mode, where you build up your character to use melee and be prepared for some face to face combat with skilled and nimble fights. The Good: - This game has by far THE BEST level design of any game of its generation, castles and terrains very well planned with inter connected areas, beautiful. - Good amount of weapons to try out. - Challenging enemies. - Great story. The Bad: - Magic is forced into any build, and it's must if you want to survive an invasion (on you or by you). - Weapons are basically magic wands, making the game a run and shoot kind of game. Melee becomes useless. - Utterly unbalanced spells and skills. Some of them become a one-hit kill while others are a joke. - Almost all armor sets are dresses, forget about all these cool designs of all other Souls games for either Type A or B body types, get used to look like deacon. - The armor alteration 'mechanic' is a bad joke, you can only remove the cape of the armors/dresses that have one. - Areas to explore (that are not castles or buildings) start amazingly designed and a joy to traverse, but such design starts to become plain and boring the more areas you advance in the game. At the end it's just large flat boring terrain lazily filled with enemies just to have something in. The game length feels artificially stretched half way through, I would have preferred the game to last half of what it takes with all these lazy designed late game areas removed. Long story short, if you like to spam spells while running away from enemies (computer or humans) you are in for a treat, because it's this game's main mechanic.",7,2022-04-21,PLAYSTATION 5
eilhart,"I played all the souls-borne games from Demon's Souls to Dark Souls 3 (except Sekiro) loved (almost) every second of them. So It pains me to say Elden Ring is absolutely overrated. Poor enemy design, ton of copy-paste enemies, technical issues, bad performance, bland open-world, terrible balancing of weapons, enemies, stats etc. Art style and the world of Lands Between (except Caelid lol) is breathtakingly gorgeous, soundtrack and (some of the) bosses are also very good, but otherwise this game is lacking in a lot of ways that previous games weren't.

paul78,"This game is demanding as it is rewarding. It immerses the player in a world full of mystery, exploration, and challenging enemy encounters while you roam the beautifully designed Lands Between with a palpable sense of imminent threat. Elden Ring is all about the combat and the weapon arts don’t disappoint, with a stunning array of weapon choices and art combinations, engaging in combat is so satisfying. The unique hallmark of FromSoft games is what it demands of the player; to learn the different tools at your disposal designed to help you overcome the difficulty in a way that suits the player. It is a much more sophisticated difficulty setting than a mere slider and has a massive effect on drawing the community together as well as making the game replay-able as you try different builds and continue discovery. There are subtle clues to direct the player, including enemies that seem too difficult; the game’s way of telling you to go somewhere else and come back when you are levelled up. It is challenging, but this makes the accomplishment all the more special. Some users who have given a zero rating because they found enemies too hard have also given Assassins Creed Valhalla a 10/10. These players need their hand holding and don’t want a challenge, they want predictable and easy. They don’t have the minerals to take on Elden Ring and are just leaving bad reviews after rage quitting. You can’t expect to one-shot enemies in this game, it requires some learning of the enemy combat move set - apparently that notion is too difficult for some. Also there are many tools at your disposal that will trivialise the game difficulty if you just put the effort into playing and figuring things out, but no these people would rather put effort into downvoting and review bombing. Elden Ring sold 12 million copies in the first 3 weeks of launch and will deservedly be GOTY. That said, it isn’t for everyone, but as a casual gamer playing when I can around work and family commitments I find it easy to pickup and play in small doses and come back to later. Performance on the PS5 is good enough if not a constant 60fps. I tried the PS4 version on PS5 and while a perfect 60fps I didn’t think the trade off was worth it.

praizeee,"Thank god most people don't actually like this game. I was actually worried that, if this games starts to influence other open world games, then gaming will be dead, but thankfully that wont happen. Removing quest log/mission log is one of the worst things you can do to your game. If this game wins GOTY, it means absolutely nothing, because Last of Us 2 also won GOTY and nobody likes that game either. Elden Ring player count on Steam has fallen under 200 000 (120 000 as i'm writing this)-all that with ONLY three months. So it's very obvious that most people bought it, because of hype, tried it and just gave up. Overall it's worse than most open world games (Skyrim, GTA V, RDR2, AC Valhalla, AC 4, GTA 4, Days Gone and list just goes on).",0,2022-04-20,PLAYSTATION 5
Justchillgames,"I'll put it as simply as possible- This game is Outdated (open world design, graphics, combat). Boring (there's nothing else to do, beside fighting bosses and that gets old fast). Soulless (It's nothing new, groundbreaking or interesting. They put big map full of bosses and that's the game, no deep storytelling, no interesting character, no depth at all). I'm disappointed that i wasted 19 hours of my life on this, hoping to find something actually interesting. All i found was endless unfair and outdated combat, bosses that have way too many combos (ruins the fun, when bosses are too strong) and overall you have to spend too much time doing same thing over and over, that's like possibly worst way you can design a game. Do you do same thing over and over in Red Dead Redemption 2? No. In that game you can move on with story anytime you want. In Elden Ring you have to fight boring bosses, most of these fights will takes you around 10 to 100 tries, that's not fun. It was never fun and it never will be fun.",1,2022-04-20,PLAYSTATION 5

FuriousAegon,"Elden Ring is fascinating! After getting my platinum for 70 hours, I can clearly say that this game is one of my favorite fromsoft games alongside with Bloodborne and Sekiro. -Gameplay, is similar to Dark Souls 3, and have some ""must-have"" parts like jumping using only ONE button, and of course the Horse Torrent because of how big the world of the game is.Also kinda new thing is Ashes of War, but they just replace grindstones and gems from Dark Souls 3. The world of this game is unusual to an open world standard, there 4 types of dungeons in this game:caves,catacombs,hero graves and tunnel and they are all interesting to investigate, and rewards with valuable **** for me open world in this game is the worst part of the game,but that doesn’t mean that it is bad, just mediocre, because of the confusion at the start of the game, when u can’t figure out where to go.Sometimes u can go to the high-level locations, and sometimes u can even get to the low-level location already being a high-level **** my opinion they should’ve done a map layout by progression levels, for example like in Witcher 3.Beside this minus, the world of the game is really good and has an unique atmosphere. -The main story of this game is one of the best stories from all games from this developer.Only bloodborne , in my opinion is better.Overall the whole conflict in the lands between is the best part of the games lore, all the lordswith their opinion about the fracture of the Elden Ring, most of them where trying to take the whole power of the Elden Ring, and for example lord Rykard was interested in devouring all of the gods, or Mohg by using Miquella and might of the shard was tring to became a God and create Mohgwyn Dynasty, or some of them like Malenia,Morgott and Godrick where just sitting in there **** if think everyone must experience it, someone may like the lore and story of the game (like me), and some may don’t like. -Main Bosses the game ( those who carry the shards of the Elden Ring ) are fascinating and unique to the whole Souls-like **** perfect example is Mohg - the best and the most fair fight in the game (in my opinion) perfect visuals,good lore before character,astonishing ost and really beatiful location.Also theres General Radahn, I’ve never experienced (UPD Ivory King with Four Knights of Eleum Loyce is very similar to this fight ) such an epic **** the friends you have met where helping you to fight Radahn, even Blaid with Alexander.Rykard is similar to Giant Yorm ( from DS3 ) and Storm Kings ( DeS ) but way harder than them , also fight is very good and fair.Morgott and Goodrick are good but usual to the whole series, but also very **** the hardest one is Malenia, and god she’s the hardest boss in whole franchise,she heals herself after hitting you and has 1 one-shot attacks in first phase, and 3 one-shot attacks in second, also she has 2 health bars.Yeah…that boss is insanely hard, and clearly the hardest boss in the **** final boss of the game - Radagon of the Golden Order and Elden Beast are also insane and has fascinating soundtarck and gorgeous design, but for me Elden Beast is a very boring and meh boss, considering to Radagon with his fast and chalenging moveset , fighting Elden Beast feels like filler boss with its jumps to another of arena and magic spam.Also the game has a lot of optional bosses : Dragonlord Placidusax (Midirs laser vibes... ), Hoarah Loux the Warrior ( 2nd best boss music in the game ), Rennala Queen of the full moon ( second phase - huge flashback to Rom, the vacuous spider from Bloodborne ), Mimic Tear ( Basically You ), Maliketh ( he’s one not optional, but he has really good design and beatiful fight), Regal & Basic Ancestor Spirit ( very relaxing ost , and very good fight ), and so on… This game have a lot of bosses. -The last thing I want to talk is graphics, and they are decent, not next-gen like in Demon Souls Remake, but not bad at all. For me Elden Ring became a very interesting journey, with memorable bosses, deep lore, and beautiful **** after getting a platinum in this game I already miss it…After beating the game for 4 times i can clearly say that this game is one of my favorite games of all time and without doubt is my third favorite soulsborne game. 9/10",9,2022-04-19,PLAYSTATION 5

Masked_Sausage,"This game isn't a masterpiece it also isn't awful. What it is, is a game that starts out as one of the most enticing and unabashed delights that, after halfway through, way overstays it's welcome. It's accompanied by a devolution into obnoxious repetition and an aggressive overabundance of poor design choices. The starting areas of this game are visually striking and unbelievably packed to the brim with genuinely fun and engaging content. The enemy designs are varied and completely FRESH to the player. As you progress through the game past a certain point, say about a 1/3 way through, you'll start to notice marked patterns that start to arise. Random dungeons are repeating aplenty, early bosses become normal enemies, and everything is getting quite a bit of a damage boost and health boost. Fret not, for this is a pretty normal staple for FromSoft fans and for newcomers it's barely noticeable. Then, it happens, you come to the realization that about 1/2 into the game, you have fought these bosses before you have seen the enemies before, you have traverses these dungeons before, you have painstay searched high and low for the new content, but it seems that it isn't anywhere to be found. So you get sick of it and instead of exploring every detail, every nook and cranny for fun interesting items and encounters... You trudge on the main path for something new. This is an evident truth for the rest of the game. You will fight bosses you have fought, sometimes, up to 5+ times, you will traverse the same uninspired dungeon designs throughout the game. You get to a point in the game where the enemy fight and environment designs are there to be just difficult for the sake of difficult, not for the players enjoyment. The latter half of this game is so incredibly devoid of any common ground between the developers and the player that you'll feel like you're playtesting a version of the game that hasn't been balanced, or finished, yet. People will play and enjoy this game, all of the way through, and I am happy for those people, but for the majority of people that play this game, it will be an unnecessarily stark contrast throughout the runtime of the playthrough. It is by no means a bad game, but it is entirely unpolished, by design, in the latter half to the point that it will exhaust anyone who isn't a diehard fan.",7,2022-04-19,PLAYSTATION 5

Leepsu,"For an open-world game, there isn’t much variety to what you can do in Elden Ring. The combat is fine and as-expected, but the graphics are not great by modern standards, and there isn’t a compelling narrative that unfolds to drive the game forward. The gameplay, setting, and story do not weave together meaningfully — it feels like these elements were developed separately and then combined without any cohesive artistic vision. Elden Ring might represent a nice evolution for FromSoftware as they explore open-world design, but it’s not particularly thoughtful in its execution. For a game to be considered a masterpiece (as reviews have claimed), there really needs to be a level of care and craftsmanship that just isn’t here.",4,2022-04-18,PLAYSTATION 5

MrUnparalleled,"Like all of FromSoft’s other new IPs this game definitely has an adjustment phase for it before the game “clicks,” but it happens faster than Bloodborne or Sekiro in my opinion. This game is a really good blend of all of their previous games. The combat isn’t as fluid or fast as Sekiro or Bloodborne, but it does well at combining the magic system from Dark Souls with faster paced combat. My biggest issue with the game is how some field bosses and optional bosses are recycled. However, the sheer amount of content and enemies does a decent job at offsetting this. The open world can be lacking in some areas, but it feels appropriate due to the lore of the area. Exploration of most areas is fairly simple, but almost everywhere there’s some well hidden unique location. The graphics are nothing to write home about from a technical standpoint, but artistically this is possibly the most beautiful game I’ve played—better than Ghost of Tsushima, God of War 4, and the Horizon Series. Areas like the capital and Nokron are places you spend so much time just looking at. The story is typical for a Souls game but it’s closer to Sekiro in terms of how ambiguous and hidden it is. As usual, this game isn’t for everyone but it’s far less niche than previous titles. If you enjoy exploration for the sake of exploration or you are a long time souls fan, this game is for you.",9,2022-04-17,PLAYSTATION 5

Danielow9,Now that I've played enough I'ma give my opinion. Just to let u know this is my second souls game so. Pro: Game visuals is great and also bosses. I like how much variety there is and u won't get bored if your with friends. Cons: The combat system is one of the most basic I've seen on a game which makes it boring for me. Also playing alone in that open world is also boring in my opinion. The co-op even tho is great the system of it ****. U get so many restrictions (There's stuff u can't pass thro unless u alone then go in and summon friends again which it takes like 5 minutes each time) sometimes u can't even see their summon and u gotta use a item to see it and it didn't even worked all the time for me I had to move from the area or restart the game (Yes we had same password etc) which it gets tiresome honestly. If u die or they die u gotta go thro all that again so ye. Not sure if the game was intented to play it alone but if u make it co-op at least make it right and less annoying. Also u can get invaded anytime which it totally ****. U get friends trying to help u then get invaded randomly and killed and u gotta go thro all that stuff again. The story so far has been meh,4,2022-04-17,PLAYSTATION 5

PaBe,"Open World Design: 10/10 Story and storytelling: 7/10 Quest Design: 8/10 Game Mechanics: 7/10 Combat Mechanics: 6/10 ### 1. World Design on the highest surprising level: The world and its design is beautiful and gigantic one. Every single area fits the wishes and dreams of an open world for casual gamers like me. Also the decision to design the world also vertically was 100% a right one. That the world don't uses the current and available state of the art next gen graphics level like other dripple A games isn't a minus, since the world still looks beautiful, also compared to its complete size. Or compared to the moments you will definitely have alone or together with a friend when you get surprised again, again, and again - after 10 Minutes, 30 hours or even in the endgame. ### 2. Story that is written but not told: Like in every From Software game the individual story isn't really told via a recognizable common thread. Based on items and every items description and some short video clips YOU are responsible to find out more about the lore of Elden Ring. But you're not alone: the community will not only support you in terms of story, quests and their individual progress. For casual gamers like me this ""story telling pattern"" isn't that convenient, since I get motivation and energy from clearly visible progress, not just ""skill-"", attribute- or story-related. Of course: Since you're responsible to find out more about the story and Elden Ring's fundament is an open world, you could say ""Every player will write and then tell its own Elden Ring story"". But after 50 hours of playing the game you will more and more get the feeling that something is missing while you found your character build, needed ashes and you find out that more and more things repeat themselves (Dungeons, Enemies, Combat Mechanics). ### 3. Quest, after quest, after quest: Quests in Elden Ring are great, some of them are amazing. But - when you start a quest you need to finish the quest asap and stop playing the story line. If not, in some cases you wont be able to finish the relevant quests. AND: You need the support of the community and Elden Ring Wikis for 6 of 10 quests. Which makes it even harder to dive deeper into the game and its story, since to search and share quest relevant information you need to switch from console or pc to your smartphone or tablet. ### 4. Inner fight with yourself until luck kicks in The combat system and mechanics of Elden Ring follows one official way: “Be open, try, fail, learn, make progress, repeat”. When you play Elden Ring you soon find out, it’s not the way above. It’s following way: If you fail. Try again. If you fail again, level your attributes, upgrade your favorite weapons in use. Google search: ""Interactive map, smithing stones"" If you fail, try again. If you fail again, start farming to become the Elden God. Google search: ""Best farming spot Elden Ring"" If you fail, google search: ""Best build for boss x/y"" and reset your attributes. If you fail again, google search: ""Cheese of boss x/y"" and don't forget to update your bow. If you fail, try again. If you fail again, ask a community player to support you in the fight. But: Don't forget that the boss will become stronger after you sum another player. If you fail, start again from the top of the list. If you fail again, LEARN to live with it. If you can't, because you have a friend which already finished Elden Ring the second time and loves to here you failing: Mute him, games music, voices (not only Malenias) and try it again! Learn to live with the fact, that getting in a fight with an Elden Ring boss means getting spammed with individual combat patterns and if you have enough luck you maybe win that fight. But: Before you win the fight, you will scream, cry, earn anger, frustration, deepest hate and a lot of destroyed playstation, xbox controllers or pc keyboards. Even at the end, when you can smell victory - not only the last 4 bosses will spam you every combat pattern the individual boss has directly in your face - like you play against a world champion of the game Super Smash Bros or Street Fighter. But you play the specific game for the first time. But, world champion gamers of beatemups don't have a second phase. Elden Ring bosses have a second one - without an endurance/condition break for spamming every combat pattern in your direction. It's not about progress, not about improvement, not about skill - if you're a casual gamer like me and you're not part of the souls community. At the end its luck. After 123 hours of playing, end level 190, and after I finished the game I finally can say: Elden Ring and it's patterns from world design, NPCs, story, contents, bosses and the unfair spamming combat system is not a masterpiece. Elden Ring is a hugh step forward for all the upcoming (open world) games in the future, not only of From Software. 7.6/10",7,2022-04-17,PLAYSTATION 5

They need to add more density rather than just a forced open world. The movement sure is more fluid than dark soul, but it is still considered very rough. Weirdly enough that they develop sekiro which has a very great and fluid movement. It seems like just a step down from sekiro. Control is very bad that you can easily push the wrong button. Multiplayer is still unplayable and very confusing. They should just copy what Nioh 2's team ninja did. The story and lore still very bad. They too focus on gameplay that made the story very shallow. They should take the example of Hollow knight, it clearly focuses on gameplay but doesn't sacrifice lore. The story of Elden ring is not that different than Nioh 2 and Strange of paradise in terms of complexity. I think that Sekiro is better than this. It's not that the Elden ring is bad. But it still cannot be considered a masterpiece as it is. And now, many dark soul themes are better than Elden ring.",7,2022-04-15,PLAYSTATION 5
D3NGZ,"once in a few years a game comes along that just pushes every button... Elden Ring is one of those games. they combined the meticulously designed ""dungeons"" of previous games perfectly into an open world setting, then filled it with wonder evoking and visually stunning ""points of interest"" seriously the way this game just pulls you into it is remarkable.. the gameplay loop is always fresh with the build options and cool enemies to fight with. Pros : - deep fun and varied combat system. so many builds weapons and spells to choose from. - interesting Lore and Characters. - Impressive World Building and design. - the Graphics design of the enemies and locations you see surpasses ""better looking tech wise"" games, the art design just carries it. it looks AMAZING. - Story is good although its kind of hidden away in items and ""make your own conclusions"" but that is part of its charm. - Animations of enemies etc are phenomenal. - Voice Acting are some of the best in the industry. - Soundtrack is again a masterpiece. - Open world that rewards exploration. - extremely vertical and layered open world. Cons : - slight frame rate issues",10,2022-04-15,PLAYSTATION 5
okies,"very very fun game, it really got me hooked. But we have to be honest the story is weak, every bossfight you can feel alot is going on. yet for some reason stuff happens. and ti ****, im a **** for big epic stories. in a game, not in the items. the best way to enjoy the story is going on youtube where a guy with a finnish name explains it better then the game does. the combat, which the game is praised on, its clunky and delayed. Ai is actually non excistant. enemies just do cycles of the same attacks. Which is ok. but not groundbreaking. the graphics, the design, epic. the execution. sometimes close to a nintendo switch in visuals. and why so diffrent compared to other users? lets be honest, the souls gamers always have been an elitist cult (still love you guys :P) but before i played this game i played horizon zero dawn. and just focussing on the combat aspect and the combat UI. it is miles ahead of any souls game. and thats probaly a bitter pill to swallow.",6,2022-04-15,PLAYSTATION 5

JackRatesGames,"If you loved Dark Souls 3, then you'll love this game. This game is Dark Souls 3 but open world with so much innovation on the open world. There is so much to explore with so many items to grab from the bosses you'll find along you're journey. Every boss feels amazing to fight and punish you just enough for your mistakes and reward you for manipulating the boss into moves that you know will guarantee you damage on the boss. The bosses are incredibly creative with amazing designs. The endgame is incredibly fun as you can go back and kill the bosses in caves and dungeons that you were not able to kill in the beginning of the game and get new items from them to use in your next journey. The only flaw I can even bring up are some performance issues but the game is so good that you would rate it an 11/10 and the performance issues are the only thing that bring it down to a sad, lowly 10/10.

Generalement,"Un titre très addictif Je n'avais jamais jouer à un soul auparavant. Malgré que j'aime beaucoup le style Nioh pour la mécanique du jeu et la possibilité d'acquérir de la connaissance via les différentes lectures. Elding ring est une aventure rendant définitivement gloire à l'illustre thématique dongeons et dragons de mon enfance. Lorsque nous parcourions les livres et imaginions les créatures les plus effrayantes les unes des autres. Elden ring demande une certaine étude de la mécanique. C'est un titre offrant une tonne de possibilités de buff. Pourtant, même bien occulté dans le titre même, c'est important de visionner les différents tutoriels offert par les youtubeurs. C'est le meilleur titre RPG jamais offert dans un totre de ce genre. Félicitations aux concepteurs. La preuve que la validité d'un titre créer pour les joueurs est possibles. Et cela, sans arnaque ou pay to win. Merci From Software. Elding ring est bien élaboré. J'avoue vraiment m'y avoir intéressé après avoir accomplis l'histoire de Final Fantasy Origins et Ghost Wire Tokyo. La difficulté est très présente par contre, les nombreuses aide sur youtube sont d'une grande utilité. N'étant qu'au niveau 50 dans le début avec le fameau Katana de météorite, cela fait vraiment une différence dans ma confiance vis à vis l'environnement. Je découvre qu'une immense mécanique est possible via le build du protangoniste. Sky is the limit comme dit le dicton. J'aime particulièrement le design et la modélisation des créatures fictives qui sont assez imposantes à ce stade de l'aventure. Pour avoir pré-commandé le jeu, je remarque une mise à jour importante côté graphisme sur la PS5. Le jeu est fluide dans l'animation et on a moins l'impression que le gazon dans l'exemple du début pousse soudainement. La rapidité et la gesture du protagoniste se voit évoluer et on en ressent l'évolution lorsque l'on monte de niveau. C'est encourageant et agréable de vouloir poursuivre. Je pense que ce titre est un exemple typique d'un Golden Game où il n'y a aucune micro-transactions, aucun pay to win et une reconnaissance de l'exploration. La table du jeu me fait penser un peu à Reckonning où chaque territoire était different avec des créatures fictives differentes. Je trouve ça réussi et ça me plaît de m'accorder du temps pour m'évader dans le monde audacieux de Elding Ring. En terminant, je pense que l'exemple d'un titre comme Elding Ring est un exemple gagnant et lucratif pour les consommateurs d'expérience vidéo-ludique. En respectant le consommateur dans son achat dans l'entièreté de satisfaction sans vouloir y inclure des micro-transactions, PTW ou prochainement des NFT. A mi-chemin de l'histoire, chaque paysage est unique. Le bestiaire est propre au paysage. Je réitère. J'apprécie beaucoup la richess de cette expérience vidéo-ludique car le le shema est vraisemblablement comme The Reckonning. Un jeu sous-coté à l'expérience unique. Je ne co.prend pas pourquoi des gens ont basher. Ce type de titre d'expérience vidéo-ludique devraient intéresser les gens fans des souls, got, médiévale, RPG (pour ma part). Si un fans de titre de course ne s'interessant pas a ce genre de titre. En quoi la valeur de sa crotique en vaut-elle? Peut-être créer un nouvel façon d'étudier la valeur de la critique des gens en référence avec un preuve a l'appuis ou un minimum de vérification que la personne s'y ait vraiment intéressé ? Finalement terminé ! Après plus de 300 heures de jeu. Platine. 1er fois, sans savoirrj 'ai fait l'âge de du chaos. En 2ieme l'âge de la mort et finalement l'âge des étoiles. Merci à tous ceux m'ayant aidé à battre les boss difficiles. In plaisir à apprendre des érudits du jeu sur youtube et Google comme consultation.",10,2022-04-13,PLAYSTATION 5
F1_is_WWE,"- This is literally a reskin of Dark Souls 3. Which Dark Souls 3, by the way, was a reskin of Dark Souls. This company has been making the same game for over a decade now and they're getting away with it. - This game is too long. If you've every played a Souls game, then you've already played this game. Same combat, same weapons, same mechanics. Now take Dark Souls and imagine it's twice as long. Games can be long if they successfully introduce new ideas to spice up the gameplay. But here you've already seen it al before; there's next to nothing new here. Add to that the recycled bosses and enemies, and you'll quickly grow bored - The bosses in this game are balanced around mimics. That is, summoning an npc to help you. If you do not summon, bosses will be so hard and unfair you'll think it is the hardest Souls game yet. It you do summon, you'll think it's the easiest.

Jamesdgreen79,"I have played every souls game from demon souls to bloodborne and sekiro, but I have never felt like any of the other games are as cheap as this one. This one pretends to be difficult but is just cheap. What I mean by that is that while previous games reward patients and learning, elden ring rewards getting lucky eventually. You just keep on trying until eventually the stars happen to randomly align and you beat a boss. Very frustrating, even when you beat a boss, you can look at it and think that the only reason you won was luck. There is no satisfaction in that.

guiletheguiles,"Elden Ring is an astonishing milestone in gaming. Just like Dark Souls, Bloodborne and Sekiro before it. That's pretty much it and nothing else needs to be said, honestly. The game isn't perfect, clearly, but it's very hard not to give it the full score, since it managed to fully swallow my life for around 200 hours. It basically made me stop looking at any other game and even threw me back to finish past From Software titles once again. The graphics and art design is beyond beautiful. The lands between urges you to explore its caves, castles, mountains, underground cities and every other nook and cranny that you can (and sometimes can't) gaze your eyes upon. Combat system is Dark Souls perfected. Everything works and flows perfectly. It's basically hitbox porn, with great movement freedom and room for improvisation. Every build is viable and the game wants you to try whatever you feel like. And it's not just the jumping that makes a difference. It's your horse and its precise movements, it's your weapon skills, your sorceries and encantations, it's the enemies, your equipment... everything! Exploration is basically the name of the game here and there are TONS of things for you to venture yourself in at the open world of the Lands Between. It's incredible. I grew tired of open world games, but Elden Ring brought something different to the table. And it's not even anything new, it's just... tasty to relish in. The map is seriously huge and, on top of the ""base quest"", you can uncover hidden cities, tombs and many other places that WILL MAKE you keep seeking more. It's addictive and quite marvelous to experience. The lore, in my opinion, is probably the highest peak of the whole package. It's insanely well written (and well voiced) and each puzzle piece fits as you progress through the main story and sidequests. NPCs are memorable, discoveries are rewarding, optional bosses and areas are perfect and the whole story is just highly compeling. George Martin and Miyazaki did a wonderful job of creating this sprawling dark world, filled with mysteries and conundrums to feast upon during your gameplay. It all feels too good to be true, right? And sort of is, but Elden Rings' cracks start to become more visible as you lenghten your visit in this forsaken land. The biggest problem I've come accross has to be the repetition of assets. I did have a lot of fun prowling through catacombs and open areas, but by the time I reached the Mountaintop Of the Giants, it started to get to me. And the bosses. One of Sekiro's biggest flaws, for me, was the amount of repeat bosses, even if it made sense in the story. With Elden Ring, this problem is enhanced due to its open world nature. I grew weary of fighting the same bosses over and over, even right towards the end of my journey. I know that these types of things are normal, but it kinds hurt the experience a bit. Not to mention how unbalanced some of them are. Other problems include how the game kinda requires you to summon spirits, some places look the same, the lack of that classic intertwined level design that From's known for, uncalled for difficulty spikes in weird places, among other things. Again, these flaws were clear, but truly harmless, when you take everything you go through in into consideration. Elden Ring is a true masterpiece and there's no other way around it. Hard not to recommend it, especially if you are a fan of Soulsborne or open world games. But it makes me wonder: where will the team go after achieving such a high level? Only time will tell, but I can't wait to see what's next.",10,2022-04-13,PLAYSTATION 5

BandiraTraveler,"Elden Ring is the most conflicted I've been about a From game since Dark Souls 2. I greatly enjoyed most of my time with the game. But I also can't see myself returning to it for further runs like I did with previous From games, nor are my feelings looking back on the game as a whole especially positive. First, the good. The game is beautiful. True, on the tech side it's hardly cutting edge; it looks like an ever so slightly gussied up PS4 game. But artistically it's the best work From has done yet. There's a vibrancy and use of color that isn't present in their other games, and some truly inventive designs for enemies and locations. The combat is also as good as it has ever been, and if you liked DS3's combat you'll likely enjoy Elden Ring's as it's mostly an expansion of what was found there. The story shares the crypticness and strangeness of the previous From games but is both more expansive and deep. And the first four fifths of the game (roughly 80 hours on my playthrough) are mostly spectacular. However, as I got further it became difficult to ignore a general degradation in the game's quality. Limgrave, the opening area, is by far the densest and most visually varied of all the game's areas. There's a healthy number of NPCs, quests, mini-dungeons, random things to find, and an amazing legacy dungeon with Stormveil Castle that feels like the best of the interconnected, maze-like levels in DS1. The next area, Liurnia, is also quite good, if not quite as good as Limgrave. Then comes Caelid, which is solid, but it's here where you start to notice things going off the rails ever so slightly. There are barely any quests, far fewer mini-dungeons, and there isn't even a large dungeon at the end like there was in the previous two areas. It feels unfinished, not in the egregious way that something like Lost Izalith did, but more in a ""They ran out of time to populate the map they made with content"" kind of way. And this trend continues as the game goes on, with a gradual but noticeable thinning of content. Enemy variety continually decreases, there are fewer and fewer quests and NPCs, more uniformity in the landscapes within each zone, and overall an increasing feeling that the game's running out of ideas and that its best moments are behind it. Then you get to the last fifth of the game and the wheel's come completely off. The last stretch of the game is, unfortunately, a slog. The endgame is poorly balanced, with basic enemies like bats and demi humans (who you've been fighting since the first hour of the game) now incredibly spongy and three shotting even over-leveled characters in heavy armor that were shrugging off the attacks of demigods a few minutes prior. Bosses start to exhibit the worst tendencies of the lesser bosses of previous From games: unreadable attacks, flailing, poor camera on larger bosses, long combos (literally a minute long in at least one case) with an opening just wide enough to get a single R1 in, terrible gimmicks, and overtuned damage/health. But this isn't the real problem with the back fifth of the game. Elden Ring's greatest strength up until now has been its exploration and sense of discovery. Its world constantly rewards you with some new enemy, area, character, weapon, etc. as you explore, and this constant discovering of new things keeps you wanting to push forward even when the game is frustrating or an area here or there is subpar. When you hit hour 80 or so, you've now seen every single enemy the game has. This is not hyperbole; outside of bosses, from this point on it is nothing but enemies you've already been fighting for many hours. There are now next to no NPCs or quests to find. There are nearly zero mini-dungeons. The game has simply run out of content, in the same way that Lost Izalith in DS1 was the moment that game ran out of steam and resorted to spamming oddly ill-fitting enemies to pad its empty areas, e.g. the dragon butts. But Lost Izalith, for all its awfulness, is an hour, maybe 30 minutes if you're quick. Elden Ring at this point has another 20 hours or so of drab monotony to drag yourself through. The game's greatest strength is all but gone for that time; by now, you've seen all it has to show you. All that's left are some empty, bland areas with recycled enemies and a gauntlet of fairly subpar to outright bad bosses to fight. I hope that some balance patches smooth out some of the rough edges of the late game, particularly with the bosses. And there's always a chance that, much like with DS1 and 2, DLC will elevate the late game by incorporating high-quality areas that were not rushed like those in the base game. But right now, those sorts of improvements are merely hypothetical. Elden Ring as it is now is an amazing game right up until it isn't. And it's tragic that it ends so poorly and in such a way that it's difficult not to have those final 20 hours taint one's perception and feeling towards the game as whole.",7,2022-04-12,PLAYSTATION 5

DweezilMoon,"my main complaint is that it is so dead, lifeless and somewhat dinjuncted. It is beautifull, and the map has tons of lovely crafted areas, but there is no interaction between the different areas at all. The enemies are incredibly stupid, starting with their ultra short sight , lack of peripheral awareness to the way they uterly ignore the world around them (ignoring corpses they are basically trodding on, suddenly missing companions, ... etc) just to return to the same short patterns. For all that matters you are fighting braindead zombies, and you do that with 2 buttons, a roll and a jump (how innovative!). I just found it pretty boring to be honest. All in all it felt like a very basic single player (don't get me started on the ""multiplayer"" part ... there is more littering in ER than in Cyberpunk 2077's street) action MMORPG. The ""story"" completely failed to grip me too, so that didn't help I reinstalled ""Dark Messiah"" (2004!) after playing Elden Ring, and whilst it doesn't have the vast spawning map, and it obviously looks dated (uses the Source Engine too btw;), the way the enemies notice what goes on around them, move far from their predefined patterns, run back to get reinforcement when they are wounded and even use the environment to their advantage was refreshing compared to Elden Ring. Same with the combat mechanics (which includes stuff like climbing beside jumping... can you imagine?!), and the story, whilst not Oscar worthy (you can't slap, but you can kick, so still not bad), is presented in an entertaining manner. I also bought a game on sale a few days ago called ""Tainted Grail : Conquest"". There is no real time combat, as it is basically a rogue like-TC:G (think ""Slay The Spire"", but with some shiny 3D graphics and really weird and gross monsters. I highly recommend it if you're looking for another kind of RPG), but the atmosphere is very similar to that of Elden Ring (it also happens in an afterlife of sort and has the same ""you're supposed to die often!"" approach), and even THAT world feels more lived in than ER's. The story is told well, the characters you meet in the different areas even interact with each other through you, and there is some persistence when you kill mobs ... something I also very much missed from Elden Ring. so ... . Elden Ring is ""okay'ish"" ... but definitely not worthy of any real praise in 2022.",2,2022-04-12,PLAYSTATION 5
Alusik,"As a soulsborne fan i wanted to give the game a 10, but that would be wrong because it's far from perfect. Many things are copied from ds, like when i was in stormveil castle i realy felt like i was in dark souls, most of the game you are in open areas some of which are very beautiful and horse makes it fun to explore, also fighting on a horse really changes the gameplay makes it more dynamic like in sekiro, but it's seriously not as much as some people say it is, like people buy fifa and call of duty every year, and these games are basically the same every time and people forgive that. Game is a lot like bb in a way that it is between ds and sekiro but bb leaning towards ds and elden ring towards sekiro.

RAGEGAMERINO,"i seriously just made an account so i can rant over this crap game. i‘m sorry i have to give it such a bad rating but i feel from my heart that somebody needs to lower it’s score. don’t get me wrong, i played demons, ds 3, sekiro etc. but man do i hate this game and everything it stands for. spare your fn time - don’t buy it. so here starts my rant: i played like 140hrs and this game is just not coming to an end. like in a bad way. it’s tedious. after all that time i‘m doing all the same crap like at the start, there is literally NO development in any case. it’s just fighting over and over and over and over and over and over again. which could be OK, but the highly appraised combat system is like the same **** like EVER. with all it’s flaws like 15 years ago. camera? super crap. hitboxes? super crap. movement? super irresponsive crap. what, theres a crappy endboss which is totally unfair cause he just spams 5 super range attacks in a row that one hit kills you over 50m? we‘ll just copy that boss later on and DOUBLE him. wow. what exceptional GAME DESIGN. now i know some virgins are gonna come up with git gut: why should i waste my fn time memorizing a tedious unfair boss by battling it 20 times? it’s just a waste of time. and the thing with difficulty is: i don’t mind difficult games. i played through returnal with six deaths, which is pretty ok i think. some say it’s the over all harder game. but you know what? it’s responsive. every button you press is immediately carried out on screen. returnal is a fn gaming heaven with hard but fair combat and the smoothest controls ever made. elden ring on the other hand is just so sluggish and lame and slow and sloppy and SO. FN. UNPRECISE. every hit i take, i‘ve 100% foreseen and pressed the damn block or roll button but the game is just so slow and badly designed… i have no words. i swear to god if my character ONCE more stumbles around like an idiot after a hit and not lifting up his shield like i tell him to, i‘ll fn break the controller in half. ITS JUST BAD GAME DESIGN. ok if the combat is bad and irresponsive, maybe roaming and exploring is cool. just two words: open world. just ride or walk 5000km to see… whatever copied ruin or magic tower or dungeon. it’s just typical open world BS. you could compress it into a nice 80hrs and it would be okish but that… which brings me to my next two points: the music fn ****. it’s like 5 tracks made of annoyingly undesdinctive ambient crap music which KILLS your ears already in limgrave after a good 10 hrs. it’s so annoying i turned the music off. for the first time in my 25yrs gaming history. the atmosphere could be a plus. but whats that? everything ruined. dark. broken, bla bla bla. it’s the same fn stuff youve heard like 10 times in a row with every from soft game. i cant stand it anymore. but worse: the storytelling is STILL AS **** AS IT HAS EVER BEEN. don’t get me wrong, you don’t have to explain everything for a good story, i‘m in the filmbizz, i know that. but that crap is just so random undefined snot, i have no fn clue who i am, the people around me, the world and places and especially what i am doing. all atmosphere gets so compromised by this non-storytelling, i could not care less about ANYTHING in this game. who am i fighting right now? why? where am i? why has he a lion on his back or breaks the reality?.. plus: you have such unsatisfying choices all over this game it makes me angry. why give me the choice to change ANYTHING, when i have NO FKN clue for whom, why and what for i make the choices. spoiler free example: i could tell you you have to make a life changing decision RIGHT NOW by saying either PIDGEON or YELLOW. you have to choose. so you choose just out of random with no fn clue why and what for. thats how EVERY decision in this game feels. you just give up to care. it’s just REALLY BAD GAME DESIGN. in the end it’s just a repetitive, unresponsive, unfair, tedious, badly designed game with bad music and even worse storytelling. i‘m so done with it. it’s so boring me out i cant even comprehend. maybe it’s fun a few hours but after all this time i couldnt care less about anything that happens randomly and screams in my face: I‘M SO BADASS WITH MY BADLY DESIGNED COMBAT AND BOSSES WHICH YOU HAVE TO STUDY 50 TIMES WHILE DYING WITHOUT YOUR FAULT BECAUSE I SPAM A RANGE ATTACK WHICH YOU’D HAVE PROBABLY AVOIDED IF I DID ANYTHING YOU PRESSED IN TIME. if you want a soulslike play ds3. its shorter, more tense and pretty much the same crap, but less crappier. OR play returnal: the epidome of good game design, responsive controls, hard but fair combat and great music and superb (still cryptic) storytelling. where returnal is a bright shining star on the night sky, elden ring is an old **** on the side of a portable potty on the most disgusting construction site of the third world. 3/10 bussi baba",3,2022-04-12,PLAYSTATION 5
Schlyter,"This is a masterpiece just like most of FromSoftwares titles. The satisfaction of making progress in these challenging games is unmatched. Even though I prefer a more linear but interconnected experience, this open world experience never gets boring. The world is filled with things to do without cluttering the in-game map. The game wants you to get lost and customize your own adventure on your own terms and there’s very little handholding from the beginning until the end. This is my perfect gaming experience and will undoubtedly be my game of the year.",10,2022-04-12,PLAYSTATION 5

Man kann fast alle side quests ohne Probleme finden und spielen welche durchaus Spaß machen und nicht daraus bestehen npc 1 zu folgen oder dem anderen einen Gegenstand von a nach b zu bringen. Keine Quest ist wie die andere und das Spiel hält immer Überraschungen bereit. Ich habe jetzt 180 Stunden Spielzeit und immer noch nicht fertig weil ich alles genieße und nichts verpassen will und das auch trotz Arbeit, einem 12 Stunden Tag und und und.

Bruiser69,"Not a fan of Dark Souls games, but decided to give this a shot due to the high ratings and recommendations from friends. The open world is vast, and allows you to bypass stronger enemies and bosses to come back when you’re stronger. I play only as single player, which which probably makes things harder than they should be. As a coop game I expect some of the boss fights would be a lot more fun. If there’s a story somewhere in the game I must have missed it, maybe will still find it; like how I missed tutorial on the basics only to realize it after finding it on YouTube. Probably none of this is an issue for anyone familiar with Dark Souls games. Still I’ve logged over 40 hours so far and will likely get my money out of this game by the time I’m done, even if I don’t complete it. Update: Completed the game. 200+ hours played, I guess I enjoyed it more than I expected! Steep learning curve but eventually it clicked. The level design in the later levels is really amazing. Overall a great game.",9,2022-04-11,PLAYSTATION 5
Ollyoxenfree,"Honestly tried to like the game because I did like the atmosphere and general world. But it soon became more frustrating than enjoyable. The game is grindy, repeats bosses, glitches out in frame rate during boss encounters (looking at you tree sentinel), and there is such a lack of any story which is funny because they attached George R Martin to this. Did he not bother to finish this story either ? Like what really happened here? This game is FAR from a 10/10. This souls game is hard just for the sack of being hard with little to no reward.

mister7,"Understand that the reviews of people who are saying that there is a hype train, and the graphics aren't good, or it's too hard, are simply apart of the ever growing hype train to bash the game because simply put, nobody cares. This game is transcendental of the entire video game medium, and literally everyone knows it. They know it will still do well, with or without their negative review scores. So all of that put aside, why is this game a 10/10 experience? Very simply put, this IS the one piece of video games. The world is simply mystical to explore, and you will guaranteed have 1 of the most memorable experiences of playing games you will ever have at some point in this game, and probably at several points. I know I have. And that's cool and everything. But it wouldn't matter if the game isn't fun to play. And well, nobody wants to spoil how amazing that consistently evolves throughout the game. My lord what what a gameplay experience! Understand that everyone who is hating on this game, has still played it for over 100 hours. And at that point, you've already got your 60$ worth. Anyway, if this game was literally just the first area, it would probably be game of the year. But they added, an entire.... idek what else.

They're fun facts of a dying world.. I know there is a superb game in there somewhere but unless you can afford to put the dozens of hours into ""getting good"" or you're already a fan boy of the company you're probably going to be miserable.

FizzAndFurious,"In many ways, the work of a critic is easy. We risk very little, yet enjoy a position over those who offer up their work - and their selves - to our judgement. We thrive on negative criticism, which is fun to write and to read. But the bitter truth we critics must face is that in the grand scheme of things, the average piece of junk is probably more meaningful than our criticism designating it so. But there are times when a critic truly risks something - and that is in the discovery and defence of the New. The world is often unkind to new talent, new creations. The New needs friends. Last night I experienced something new: an extraordinary game from a singularly expected source. To say that both the Elden and its maker FromSoftware have challenged my preconceptions about fine game design is a gross understatement. They have rocked me to my core. In the past, I have made no secret of my disdain for Chef Gusteau's famous motto; ""anyone can design"" But I realise, only now do I truly understand what he meant. Not everyone can become a great artist, but a great artist can come from anywhere. It is difficult to imagine more humble origins than those of the genius now directing at FromSoftwares - who is, in this critic's opinion, nothing less than the finest Kojima in the World!

KyleBleser,"Score: 8.2 Graphics: 7.5 Art Design: 9.5 Audio: 9.5 Performance: 8.5 Gameplay: 9 Story: 7 (faulters from Gameplay) Originality: 5 First and foremost, quite a massive game. Theres no shortage of content and you could play for 100s of hours. That being said, ER is easily the most accessible From Software game on the market. Though some enemies can be more difficult than past Dark Souls, the fact you can overlevel so easily plus the better balance of MANY types of builds and improved combat system helps a ton in making it easier than its predecessors. Its also much easier to regain lost Runes after death making death itself feel a lot less daunting. Improved pacing of the open world would have better remedied the overleveling and power spike issue. The open world gameplay is definitely well-done for the most part. I love the freedom and exploration along with the mystery. Though I would have enjoyed better AI in the open world with greater variation (sometimes feels bland with the AI being overly scripted). Also, AI needs to better counter ranged attacks. You can abuse Sorcery spells against most enemies including bosses. Plus, pacing through the open world is sometimes slow--this will be hard to control in a large open world vs the past Souls games but I think theres definitely more that could be done in ER. All-in-all, the game does well at staying true to its Dark Souls roots within the open world. That being said, ER is easily one of weaker graphics of the new generation of games (pretty much just Dark Souls 3 upgraded). Highly outdated on some parts (such as foliage, trees, and character models which is obvious) and this was quite disappointing for a game that has such excellent atmosphere and art design--there are moments of beauty in the massive scale though such as with castles. Not only that, but there are moments of clear performance issues at times which is unusual for a game that is graphically inferior, has weaker AI systems, and not that much in the way of physics compared to most modern games, especially when compared to Horizon Forbidden West which is incredible what those devs did with their engine. In ER, you will have pop-in left and right of foliage. Rendering distance is pathetic. Often frame rate drops (im on performance mode btw). Lip syncing is abysmal. Enemies just outright disappear when they leave their 'zones' which makes for awkward moments. In my opinion, From Software needs to potentially look into a new engine. The game overall runs smooth but definitely dated. Also, the pacing of the narrative is not good. The narrative becomes a victim of its own gameplay design with the massive, free open world. Without REALLY tracking every narrative detail, it feels like a puzzle with thousands of pieces that you have to find and put together. I really did not like this as it made the narrative feel extremely disjointed and slow. This will of course vary from each persons experience. When the story is put together, its extremely intriguing and characters are amazing. The open world could also use more ""depth"" in building its narrative. Some buildings and objects just feel out of place in the design of the world and dont make sense. Yes they add atmosphere but good attention to detail can also give ""background"" or history to certain objects. Lastly, progression and balance of builds needs improved. On your first playthrough, you will definitely feel ""locked"" into a build and weapons till you get closer to endgame. A little more freedom to catching up certain weapons in scaling and respecing would be welcoming for how many different items there are. Attributes could also use some balancing, primarily how Weight Limit is treated along with Vigor being excessively relied upon up to its soft cap--HIGHLY dislike this and hopefully gets a bit rebalanced. Plus, cancel animations needs further tuned. Faster enemies from previous games should mean a bit more responsive character. Too many times I get locked in slow animations (like Flasks) or rolling just fails to respond. Greater refinement in this area. In the end, still a great game. Definitely worth it for the gameplay alone--definitelys an insane amount of content. Just not ""next gen"" nor is it entirely revolutionary. Its mainly Dark Souls 3 in an open world with improved and greatly balanced combat system. BUT, i hope other open world games (be it Ghost of Tsushima, Horizon, AC, etc) take notes that limited markers and bloated ""collection"" pieces are not necessary since consumers love mystery and freedom in their exploration. On the other side, theres definitely some things From Software could do better. Such as once we collect unique items (like Tears or defeated Bosses), to put a marker on the map that resembles that its been collected. BUT the gameplay loop is definitely excellent and the game is the most accessible of all the Dark Souls. Definitely worth a try.",8,2022-04-11,PLAYSTATION 5
enguerranws,"Elden Ring is not a bad game, far from it. In a nutshell, it's Dark Souls 4. It has all the strength of the Souls series, but still has all its issues. Moreover, Elden Ring has a big lack of novelty. You can use a ""horse"" and jump, that's all. When Sekiro or Bloodborne tried to push the souls series in a different way, Elden Ring simply reuse the DS recipe. It also reuses skins, animations, textures, and the old DS graphics, so, even 1 year and a half after the PS5 release, it feels like you're playing on a PS4.",6,2022-04-11,PLAYSTATION 5

Serpicobeard,"As a huge fan of the Dark Souls games i was really looking forward to Elden Ring and it does not disappoint. A huge and beautiful dark fantasy open world which is a joy to explore, there's so much to do and find and some really cool and fun boss fights. The game just drips quality it's really well made and atmospheric. There's so much freedom in building your character and tons of different weapons, armour and magic spells to find. There's also zero busy work which is something which ruins most other open world games. They nailed it, it's awesome. It isn't perfect though as at times i feel the game is just too difficult for the sake of it. Near the end of the game i was over level 100 and had a maximum level weapon so i was able to crush regular mobs with a few hits but i was barely scratching the bosses. Unless you want to spend hours trying to beat a single boss then summoning other players is essential. Also the final boss is complete nonsense. You are required to beat two of the hardest bosses in the game in a row with no rest in between. Basically you have to get perfect at beating the first boss before you can even practice how to beat the second one and i think that's a step too far. I have finished the Dark Souls games multiple times but i can't see myself returning to Elden Ring for a while even though i loved the game up until the final boss. Overall though this is a really great game and i'm looking forward to the DLC.",8,2022-04-10,PLAYSTATION 5

But I'm giving this a bad review. The graphics are good and it's generally fun to explore the world and develop your character. But the boss fights (even mini bosses in dungeons) are incredibly hard. You will die over and over and over again. That's just how this game is designed. Even a ""good"" player will die a lot until they memorize the boss moves and learn to execute every dodge/block with exact timing. This breaks my immersion and is generally frustrating and no fun. They could have made this a fun game by simply putting in a difficulty setting so that gamers who want to play a RPG game for exploration and immersion can enjoy it. Edit: I should mention the ""story"". There apparently is one but you'll be challenged to understand what it actually is. There is some sort of random NPC talk about historic events but honestly I'm in end game now and can't really tell you much about the story line. I watched a YouTube video a guy put together about the ""lore"" and it was far more informative than the game. So ... what did GRR Martin actually contrbute here? It can't have been much. A few minor complaints: no quest log. Huh. That's a first in any RPG game I have to say. No hot keys for the (MANY) spells available (that's a game breaker really).

MystifiedMist,"An undescribable amount of effort has been put into this game. The openworld exploration is simply flawless to say, there's a surprise for you in every corner. There are rewards out there that ACTUALLY help you in some or the other way. Running unto npcs has never been more surprising and each of the NPCs are so unique and different than one another. Although the questlines are difficult to complete without wiki help. Boss design is also tremendous and one of the best I have ever seen. Each boss has unique and different mechanics. Learning all of their moves and beating them feels really satisfying. Although sometimes it can be quite unforgiving. Lastly, don't trust all these negative reviews. They are trash fortnite gamers who never played a real video game or are jealous of Elden Ring.

lovefromhate88,"I do not review this a 10 lightly, i have just got the plat after almost 100 hours. This is as much of a perfect game as you can get. Obviously you can’t please everyone as people have their own tastes but this game is remarkable. Often when a genre evolves into something else they lose some of what made the previous games so good. Fromsoftware have managed to evolve their genre into open world and keep everything that makes soulsbourne games amazing. You have all the same style lore, where you are left with only a very vague guide as to how to progress. The amount of weapons, spells, incantations and so on is incredible. Each build feels different. I played the bulk as a mage and almost all spells had a use in a certain scenario. They have made sure not to present filler spells like in previous games. I found myself trying out all of them. What i love about this game is people will be finding secrets for years to come. I love to see the insane secrets people discover. The only other game with that level of design is RDR2. You feel like you are in a living world. It feels like the enemies and NPC have a life when you arent on screen, like you have interrupted them. It’s difficult to explain, but it is so immersive. They have made it a little easier (save a few bosses, Malenia for example, christ she is awful). The reason i think its a tad easier is dur to openworld, you dont get log jammed in an area as you can leave and come back. Its actually insulting that anyone who has played Elden Ring would score it less than a 7. Even if the game is not your taste it is ridiculous to even claim this isnt a 7+ on performance alone. Shame on you review bombers. We need to appreciate and celebrate games like this. Games you can tell are made with passion by people who want to play them. 10/10",10,2022-04-07,PLAYSTATION 5

Don't believe the hype and marketing, this is just another Soulsborne style game EXACTLY like the others but with open world. If you already like their games, you'll probably love this one, but if you don't... don't buy their games. Edit: on further play, this game is so incredibly buggy.

You can see why people are raving about the originality here. Gameplay wise, think Dark Souls crossed with Dark Souls crossed with an empty map. You won't find side quests (not legitimate ones), side activities, a story, or anything else, but the combat does have quite a bit of depth. Lots of talk about the open world but honestly I've seen nothing to write home about. There's no way to engage with this world beyond fighting bosses in it (because again, this is Dark Souls).

I think Elden ring is definitely incredible and a game you should try out if you are interested. If you are new to souls like game then you might have a pretty rough time though ngl. The only reason I found this game easy at all was probably because it felt so much like Ds3. A few things I have issues with: Gravity and falls are kinda inconsistent Weird jank and glitches reskin bosses and duo bosses using previously seen bosses the last boss is underwhelming/boring as a melee build pvp is a nightmare unbalanced as hell some good things?

I’ll expect and accept nothing less than Game Of The Year for this sensational game! It features a gigantic map with over a hundred hours of content in a single play through.

SeanTK,"I never write game reviews, but after reading all the bad reviews I felt like I needed to offset at least one of them. This will be short and sweet. The Game is hard. As a 35 year old man that is use to playing hard nes games such as megaman and other titles, it's a breath of fresh air compared to other games that hold your hand. It's a beautiful game, just go look up screenshots of in game game play and the environment. It runs near perfect in framerate mode. I'm almost 80 hours in and I would suspect I'm close I'm halfway done with the game. There's so much to it and so many secrets I take my time exploring every inch of the map. This game is so good and it already has been wishing it wouldn't end. The only reason I scored it a 9/10 is because of the multi-player. I can tell the developers want you to play this solo, but it so much fun playing with a buddy. The developers make it a hassle to play with each other and you constantly have to resummon a friend to keep playing.

SevenArmedGod,"I’ve never touched a Fromsoft title before, and have long feared their purportedly oppressive difficulty (A thrashing on the first mission of Nioh 2 only deepened this fear). However, this game got me hooked, and I’m reassessing my feelings about the genre. Elden Ring is a wonderful game, and I’ve thoroughly enjoyed it. I think that it is not without its flaws, However, Fromsoft has been alright about fixing some of the mechanical issues, and the game is massive. First I’ll start off with the issues. The most obvious being that it is a hard game, there is an uneven distribution of difficulty currently, with an emphasis on some of the somewhat mindless duo boss fights. There are also very tough enemies in the open world that will surely obliterate you if you challenge them just out of the gates. Besides that a few bosses have already been nerfed, the open world nature of this game allows you to level in order to closer match the difficulty of encounters and areas to your own skill level. Next are frame rate and graphics. This game has nothing approaching revolutionary graphics, and its frame rate is prone to drops when encountering high numbers of enemies at once. However, the frame drops have not caused major issues undue damage or deaths in my play-through so far. In addition, despite the minor graphical upgrades from Dark Souls 3, Elden Ring still contains striking imagery using colors and visuals against the grey, war torn landscapes of the Lands Between to great effect, easily one of the most beautiful games in that regard. Lastly are the nitpicks, the enemy AI is not amazing, they are often tethered to a certain area, leading to awkward moments where they will be extremely reluctant pursue you past a very apparent point to an almost comical degree, as well once you’ve over leveled, some of the minidungeon bosses in the early game become totally trivialized, an unfortunate side effect of the way things run in the game. There is also a vague story, told mostly through small details, inferences, and snippets of dialogue from the occasional NPC. The Lands Between are ravaged by war and stagnation due to the ****, however it can occasionally feel quite empty of normalcy. As well, the game has a still evolving map, that as of right now makes it difficult to complete quests without the aid of fellow players via the internet. On the flip side, this game finally offers an answer to the “git gud” content wall in the form of the near total openness of the world and its leveling. If you’re lacking in skill (like me) you can use that to gain a few levels and even the playing field against bosses, summoning has a similar effect, but the game does make those optional to grant those Souls veterans the challenge they demand. The lore is quite interesting, and not all questions are answered, R. R. Martin has done well with the big picture lore elements here. As well, experiencing this world is uniquely interesting due to its lack of hand holding and fruitless repetitive fetch quests (other than acting as a courier between a few NPC’s once or twice, though the pace you do that is up to you in the end). The major zones feel unique and game shines where it counts, adding in loads of ambiance. While I recognize there is more to be asked here, I think that this game delivers a new degree of life to the Souls genre of games, and leaves me wanting more. I look forward to further patches, content, and other work surrounding this game and its universe. I would definitely highly recommend this game to anyone looking for a deep or difficult experience in an interesting world with fascinating lore. One of the best games in recent memory, and certainly one of my favorites.",8,2022-04-05,PLAYSTATION 5
That_blind_guy,"This game is a souls game. It has a deep story that you need to look for, it has a great combat system you need to learn.

Siento que es el primer juego de la saga que me ¨obliga¨, a subirme el stat de vida a un nivel alto, si no, muchísimos enemigos del late game y jefes te hacen oneshot con casi todo su arsenal.

The graphics are great, it doesn't ""have to be better"" than it's predecessors in order for it to be a great game. Why some cry over "" bad graphics"" is beyond me - I don't see anything bad about it on the ps5. If you don't get the rolling, dodging and bashing then maybe Tetris is better game for you. Personally, this is one of the best games I ever played. Lastly, another thing people complain about - because they love complaining is the controls? For real? How wil the controls be better? I don't see or understand why that is an issue. Compared to most other games, this one is without a doubt a winner for those who love a challenge and an open world.",10,2022-04-05,PLAYSTATION 5
svensenk86,"so finally I managed to jump in Elden Ring, had it already on release day, but Forbidden West and another round of Zero Dawn took time....tough to go into that world when you come out of Horizon, which is much more beautiful, colorful and a driven story based **** the first hours were really tough and I thought of quitting and putting it aside first, but no, I liked Demon Souls, I liked Dark Souls so I waited for that trigger to keep me playing, and there it was, now I am stuck in this world ;) it is all the best from DS3 and Demon **** more you get into that the more you like it! graphic wise it cannot challenge Horizon, not even Zero Dawn, but it still looks pretty good sometimes. the enemies are awesome, Lord of the Rings feeling! The best improvements compared to prev Souls games: Refill of the healing drinks during open world travels, fair save points in the encounters, challenging, but fair. The worst: No quest log, I don`t know what the idea behind is, but it is impossible to remember every NPC quest...there is no sense at all I find not to have a **** this alone minus 2 **** do I need to google first what I have to do in castle Morone for example first. the other minus is for the performance on the PS5, in Horizon which is much more detailed and beautiful it is smooth as hot butter, but in Elden Ring I find myself with lags....annoying sometimes.

ChildoVision,"One of the best games of the decade! It feels like every game From Software ever released was merely a trial for the gigantic and incredible experience that is Elden Ring. Being a huge fan of the Soulsborne series myself, I was completely awed by the way From Software merged together the best aspects of every single entry into one mindblowing open world game. The world feels amazing and detailed, exploration rewarding, the top notch art and sound design create an incredible atmospheric surrounding that one can get truly lost in for hours. The newly added features to accompany the open world design such as horse riding, more accessible fast travel and additional save points work perfectly well. The world feels detailed and full of things to discover. Since Elden Ring introduces some of the sagas most incredible boss fights, new freedom in exploration while staying true to the original feeling of the Soulsborne series and further enhancing the always amazing combat system, most veterans will for sure enjoy this installement. Added to this, the open design as compared to the mostly linear level design of the other From Software games will definitely open up Elden Ring to a wider range of players. While the game is still ""hard"" as compared to other current triple A titles and can therefore feel frustrating from time to time, the variety of tools the player is handed as well as the option to simply leave when being confronted with an overpowered enemy and return at a later stage after leveling up makes it more accessible even for players who have not yet had any expierence with the Dark Souls franchise. Furthermore, I feel like I have to specify how incredible huge this game is. Even rushing through only the main bosses and dungeons (the main dungeons being called „legacy dungeons“), it will still most likely take you up to 30-40 hours to complete it, with this number getting easily pumped up to over 100 hours if you take your time for exploration, side quests and optional bosses. You for sure get a lot of content for your money. However, even the best games are not without flaws and Elden Ring is no exception. Despite being the most accessible any From Software game has ever been, it still could use some more explanation and especially new to the series players might feel lost and overwhelmed at the start. It seems like From Software intends the players to play the game with occasional consultation of online forums and wikis, which is fine, but should be considered. Added to this, the game seems to be suffering from some technical issues and bad porting to PC, ranking the PC version of the game significantly lower then the ones for consoles. Playing with mouse and keyboard seems to deteriorate the overall experience by quite a bit as compared to the seemingly intended way to play with a controller. This review is created for the PS5 version after the day one patch. While playing no technical issues or framedrops occured, therefore this aspect of criticism of the game was not relevant for my personal playing experience. I strongly recommend anyone that likes fantasy action RPGs to try it out, no matter if you already have any experience with other Soulsborne titels or not. Don’t get yourself locked out of this adventure by fearing the so often cited high difficulty of this installment and just give yourself the chance to get soaked into the incredible and mindblowing journey that is Elden Ring. This game made me rediscover the amazement and excitement of childhood / teenage gaming like no other game has done for years. All in all, despite some minor flaws, Elden Ring for me is one of the best games of the decade and without any doubt a masterpiece.",10,2022-04-05,PLAYSTATION 5

Despite that, it is a game with a massively unbelievable scope, an absolutely fascinating world full of mysteries and a real sense of discovery (can't help but compare it to BOTW) and a MUST-play (like all the other FROM games).",0,2022-04-05,PLAYSTATION 5
CharlieDee,"I've never been a brother with the Souls series. I never touched any part, and the only game from FromSoftware that I finished was Sekiro. I watched the trailers and gameplay of the Elden Ring and decided to give it a try. I will not say that seeing videos on Youtube, I was most captivated by the beautiful open world. So, the game was purchased a month after the premiere and started: I soaked in 125 hours of wonderful gameplay. FromSoftware's storytelling style is so great that I couldn't tear myself away from my computer. I spent about 100 hours exploring every bit of the map, patting the optional bosses and riding my horse wherever my eyes can see me. More than once, I found myself turning in a specific direction because I was meeting something equally interesting. In order not to write too much, I will mention the most important points in my opinion: PROS: + a beautiful open world with a huge amount of content that encourages detachment, + interesting story and nicely written characters - I got hooked so much that after finishing the game I sit and read lore on the internet. + interesting combat system, lots of weapons, nice attacks, ashes of war, skills, + the system of summoning ghosts to help - he saved me many times in the fight against the boss and it was pleasant to develop this large number of ghosts. + HORSE - perfect for exploring the world - nice speed, not muddy, something great. + Bosses - bosses everywhere, no matter where I entered it was a satisfying boss fight after clearing the area. + Grind - some treated it as a minus, but I thought the runes for the next lvl were very pleasant and I watched my character develop with pleasure. + difficulty - compared to Sekiro, it was quite easy here. I tortured the Crucible Knight the most in the eternal prison (out of 30 times), but Melania came down the first time :) the last BOSS after the third. + Rivers of Blood - this katana is a dream",10,2022-04-05,PLAYSTATION 5
Hixoustar,"One of the the rarest games on the planet, the first open world game that let me stick to my joystick since skyrim , the difference here is that elden ring let you explore the world in a new manner, there is no marker no quest log just you , simple map and the world , there a lot of things to do , many bosses , areas to explore and all that is gratifying, i am playing it since release and i am on my 170 hours on my first playthrought,i dont want it to end yet and i am enjoying it a lot !",10,2022-04-05,PLAYSTATION 5

Far Harder then any Souls Game ever made, including Sekiro and Nioh 1-2. The one and only main Problem here is the incomming dmg. The dmg is so extremly high that its just impossible to play the Game as a Melee even as an Souls Veteran. Many Attacks just oneshot you, a lot of attacks twoshot you...this is not fair and not fun to play. And Miyazaki lies about the difficulty. He said that more Player see the End of the Game, more then in other Souls **** a Lie. He made the Game far harder increasing the incomming dmg by (i think) 40-60% to other DS Games and Lied to sell more Copys. ER ist the worst Souls Game ever Made. You can play as a Mage, you can play with the -50% dmg Mod on PC or the can get oneshottet 20 times a day. Payed 70$ for this crap Balance.",0,2022-04-04,PLAYSTATION 5

Crofto,"Technically, this is an abomination. Patchy framerate. Poor hit detection. Low-res textures. Awful sound design. Going from a modern open-world title - like Horizon: Forbidden West - to this, demonstrates a staggering lapse of effort from From Software in terms of developing next generation games. This is a PS3 title in all but name. In terms of gameplay, it's Dark Souls open world. But with the same combat. Weapons. Enemies. Menus etc. Recycled assets. Recycled systems (summoning is as archaic as ever; what happened to just pressing 'start > invite friend for coop'?). The narrative is practically non-existent and beyond abstract. And I don't mean 'abstract' in a Lynchian chin-stroke way, I mean 'abstract' as in going into a museum of modern art, nearly bumping into a set of stacked chairs only for the curator to yell at you for disturbing the 'art'. It's poor. The hyperbole surrounding this game is quite staggering, as are complicit paid ""professional"" college boy drop out reviewers. It's a 10 year old game wrapped up in hype, slapped across a technically abysmal open world, with back-of-box tickers such as 'crafting' added to make it seem fresh and modern. But it isn't. Elden Ring is a decent hack and slash game. There's still enough merit to the Demon's Souls formula to make it a decent game to play, but it is in no way a leader of the gaming medium. Take away the From Soft logo, and people forget about this game in a few weeks. That' the reality.",6,2022-04-04,PLAYSTATION 5
JakeySnakey,"I remember the first time I stepped off the ship in Morrowind into a small burg, I felt goosebumps. It felt like a wide open world, full of secrets and ready to be explored. That game was magical. I had the same feeling when I pushed open a tomb door and stepped out into Limgrave. I don’t finish many 40+ hour games because, eventually, my sense of immersion is lessened or gone completely, and I feel like it’s time to move on. Sometimes I push through to the end credits and just don’t feel that satisfied with the adventure; there’s always that feeling of “I should be doing something else right now” lingering in the back of my head. My first playthrough of ER took 117 hours. When it was finished, I felt like I’d gone on an epic journey. I’m looking forward to the next playthrough. In my opinion, only FromSoft is putting out experiences like this right now. It will be a game that turns off many people, but for every person who can’t get into it, there will be someone like me who didn’t know how badly they needed this thing.",10,2022-04-04,PLAYSTATION 5

Twn,"Coming from the other games in the Soulsborne series I didnt know what to expect, yet this game has managed to surprise me. Elden Ring is a current day masterpiece, from its design to its gameplay, everything has scratched and pierced perfection. I cannot talk enough about the greatness of this game. All of the boss encounters are unique and challenging, and the reward you gain from every encounter is unmatchable. You don't get many in-game rewards for beating the bosses, but you get a personal achievement. This game is awesome, the music is insane, the world is vast, and enormous, the gameplay is crazy. I 100% recommend this game.",10,2022-04-03,PLAYSTATION 5

NxtDoc,"Elden Ring is undoubtedly another ""Souls"" game. And that, at it's core is perfectly fine. HOWEVER, From Software truly struggles to differentiate their games. If you have played Demon's Souls, Dark Souls, DS2, DS3, Bloodbourne, and Sekiro (a Souls like Tenchu) you will almost immediately recognize the same tired animations, ""bonfires"" and sound effects. For the hardcore fans that is all they play, they may feel right at home and comforted by a few of the reskinned enemies. If this were EA or Ubisoft they would be crushed. But somehow FS gets a break and praise. Not from me. Again FS releases another poorly optimized launch for their already tired and uninspired combat system. The graphics are as usual From Software, under par. But sure the world has a very pretty ""Set Piece"". The soundtrack is minimal as usual. But nicely done. Voice acting in Elden Ring is decent, as is the story. But that isn't ""the point"" right? It's about overcoming challenges..... and the biggest challenge with From Software is their inability to make a new IP without making it feel the same as their prior work. (An example being BioWare's Dragon Age, and Mass Effect are made by the same group, same genre and play completely differently. Elden Ring is solid. But hell no is this game near perfect. I am worried about those who reviewed it. It seems like bias fans reviewing it",5,2022-04-03,PLAYSTATION 5
Sherrdreamz,"A Superb open world experience that offers free exploration in which any direction you go something unique and special awaits. No game has offered this level of exploration in existence, and the incredible scope of the lands between offer an incredibly in depth world down to its Lore, Regions and even weapon, Armor and magic options. As a huge From Software fan this is what Hidetaka Miyazaki always imagined for his open world Souls experience. To see it finally realized is a huge privilege as Elden Ring is in my Top 3 games of all time even though its open-ended design decreases the games overall challenge. In some capacity perhaps making the game open world has opened up the Souls style gameplay loop to more people. If so its been worth it as the games quality is still top notch.",10,2022-04-03,PLAYSTATION 5

goker42154,"World Design is great. Huge Variation of Monsters. But the gameplay is not really good. It is basically a Hack&Slay with not much variation in Combat. You get lot's of stuff in the game, but most of it is useless and does not really help against Bosses. Boss Fights are mostly silly try to hit enemies feet (because they are all quite tall, the feet is the only thing you can reach), jump and roll around like crazy to escape attacks with a bit of luck. Your Died. With the 50th attempt you may win with a lot of luck. Really fantastic looking end bosses but such poor game mechanics.

HeraticParadox,"This is my first soulslike game. I wasn't going to play it but I picked it up because of they hype surrounding the game, and I can't put it down. I love the world. I love exploring it, and I love that the game rewards you for exploring it. It feels to me like an RPG should. I love that you learn about the story through interactions with NPCs, enemies, and exploration. It really feels like you're making your own story in the world, and I think that's something a lot of RPGs today miss out on. I wasn't sure I'd enjoy the difficulty level in the game, but I can honestly say that I enjoy it. It's hard, but fair. Beating bosses feels meaningful. One of my favorite things about the game is the art direction. Some people have complained that it's graphics fall short of top tier for gen 5 systems, but the game's art direction more than makes up for it. I think it's going to continue to look beautiful for decades to come even as graphics continue to improve. I really can't recommend this game enough.

Nobody1234,"I do not understand why those who love the game love it so much. I played the game for 20 hours and heard 30 sentences in total, how is this a perfect game? Is it the game of the year to make a map and fill it with ridiculous bosses and creatures? I've played the game for 20 hours and I don't understand what's going on in the game, there is no such nonsense game. There are already a few dialogues in total, and they wrote them so strangely to create mystery. For example, I see someone in the game, I think he will talk about what the game is about. He makes two stupid sentences and says go on, I can't deal with you. When I went to that round table, for the first time I said, ""Okay, now they'll tell you two things"". They said two ridiculous things. Someone said let me know if you see that woman, a woman hugged me and then said f.. off now. The other one has a wheel on his head, he said, ""Let me teach you something"" and he was teaching magic. Someone stands and looks at me and doesn't speak at all. Something like two statues is holding on to a stick selling something, what kind of environment is that? Tell me this. Is not it? For example, I came across something like a big cauldron while I was traveling, it was stuck on the ground and I saved it by hitting it, so this is not a normal type, is it? You have to explain this, the talking cauldron, it has hands and arms, what is it, where did it come from? No. ""I'm alexander I'm traveling"" that's it??? I entered one cave, there are wolves etc. Then I went through a fog and there's a creature I can't remember the exact name of, something like the monster man of azura. I killed him and got out in 5-6 tries. Eh? What's up now? What did I understand, he is a type that looks like he has mutated from wolves, what is he looking for here, who is he? They modeled it and threw it there, two moves, it's over. Is this the perfect game? In short, there is no story that draws me in. If there is a story with a boss, you are ambitious to learn the continuation of that story, you try to defeat it, right? What's the story in this game? What motivates you in this game? What makes you wonder to continue? Does the next boss shoot by spinning, or does he create a sword out of nothing and shoot to understand it? For example, I think that first boss appeared in a place like a bridge. Tarnished etc. he said. Who is this? What does it do? What's the deal with this? His face is like rabies, he hits with a big stick in one hand, hits with his tail, throws out an imaginary knife, hits with an imaginary sledgehammer, hits with an imaginary sword, but what is the place of this in that story? I watched a few videos and there are too many meaningless bosses. I don't think any of them are told about their story, because as I said, I played for 20 hours and I must have heard 30 sentences or something. The cat statue is the boss, the dragon is the boss, the big horse is the little boss, etc. Even the item names are meaningless. There was an item named something like ""white pickled rabbit"" :D I think the man who did it thought ""let this boss have a tail, hmm this one has 30 hands, what should it be, sir? Let it shoot"" and shook everything out of his head. Anyway, I guess people thought they would make up a story in their head. If there is a decent story, do I have to open it and look it up on the internet etc.? Tell me the story in the game. I would like to learn the story of the game in the game, not by asking uncle google, we are playing a game, after all, we are not doing thesis research, are we? The game world is full. Get out of there. If we don't see the game, we will eat it. Creatures wandering around aimlessly. Go around and kill. Is this the full world? There is no sign of a living world or the like. I played a total of 30 hours with other characters and I always played in the mind of ""people have always loved this game, what do I not understand, I should love it too"". But it's a very bad game. You're stuck on a hype. The game also got 96 points??? What does 96 points mean? It means everything has to be perfect. Performance issues alone should have prevented him from getting that score. No story, no enemy AI. If we look at the graph, it **** too. If other games had these problems, the whole game world would curse that game. But if you ask about this game, the answer is always the same ""Souls games don't look for these"" :D Don't look at the animation, don't look at the graphics, don't look at the story presentation, don't look at the optimization, what the hell are we looking for? Come to a boss, die 50 times to that boss, go back that way, memorize the moves of that boss and finally when you kill him, ""oovaaaauuuvvv, this is the game, what a defeat, this is the pleasure of difficulty, yiaaa"". The game is just that.",3,2022-04-03,PLAYSTATION 5

BernuGeek,"My final and brief opinion on Elden Ring: They were right on many things, they were wrong on many others as well. The first experience is incredibly memorable and the main bosses are amazing, the lore is nothing to talk about, although I think it's very similar to Dark Souls and lacks a bit of originality. The problem is that there comes a point, more precisely in the second half of the game, that it gets very repetitive, the optional bosses are very forgettable, the boss repetition is ridiculously annoying and the game balance is so unstable to the point that you are OP without nor make effort, ruining the Experience. The soundtrack is far inferior to past games, especially if we compare it to Dark Souls 3 and Bloodborne, you can count on your fingers which ones are really memorable and incredible. The exploration of the world itself is phenomenal and intuitive, it's really a revolution of the open world system, but unfortunately that's only true for the first time playing, making the game have very little replay factor, as you've already seen all the new exploration. In short, the game is amazing and extremely fun and addictive, it has a lot of successes but it also has a lot of flaws. For FromSoftware's first open world game, I'd say they are to be congratulated, they improved a lot from the other games, but honestly it could have been better. If they had more creativity and time, the game would be immensely more memorable and most of the game's serious flaws would be minimized. Overall, it's an unforgettable game on your first playthrough and it's really worth it, it's not quite a masterpiece as many have said, for me it's basically an open world Dark Souls 4, but it's worth the investment, especially nowadays where the market of Videogames only cares about money and quantity, while FromSoftware cares more about the artistic factor and quality in their games. Final rating: 8/10",8,2022-04-02,PLAYSTATION 5
AcogNomu,"Don’t listen to all these trashy reviews saying the game is terrible, this game is easily one of the best games to ever be made, the whole experience of a souls game is dying over and over because it’s supposed to be difficult, you’re just complaining that you couldn’t get past most things, and you’d just run away from them. This game has amazing gameplay and amazing graphics and all other goods, this is easily game of the year. I’ve beat the game several times myself and I haven’t found boredom yet, it’s just combat on combat, and if you’re reading this saying “oh all you do is go around on your horse all the time there isn’t any combat” that’s just because you’re too scared to lose to the enemies, they’re everywhere and you can find combat almost every place you go.

Everything is just a masterpiece in this game! and heck those 92 hours ive put in flew quickly! and there is still so much more to do and im in love with this game! As a long time souls fanboy and especially a Massive fan of Miyazaki games, this is what i have been waiting for and i cant wait fo the next game Miyazaki pulls of. And for the DLC thats to come in elden ring, and yes! there are sidequests and even after the main campaign (depending on your ending) that do open a door for dlc and more to come in the world of elden ring.",10,2022-04-01,PLAYSTATION 5

Potter0934,Not a Fromsoft fan but wanted to give this a try due to the hype. This game does some things really well and I have been enjoying it for the most part. The open world is beautiful and a joy to explore. Wonderful character/environment design. Hands down the best I've ever **** Stat upgrading in an RPG is a big thing for me and I think the whole( dying you lose runes and you need runes to upgrade) needs to go! Some of the boss battles are WAY too difficult! Stop making battles for only hardcore souls fans to continue the game. Either that or put a difficulty selection in the menu. Lastly ummm how about some story telling please. This was pretty sad. Quest/story developers were pretty much not there. Had no clue where to go next for main story or npc side quests.(don't give me this you just have to look garbage) It just seemed lazy. This easily could have been one of my favorites of all time and converted a non souls **** it didn't. Its lack of story telling/direction and pandering to only one type of player simply was not good.,7,2022-04-01,PLAYSTATION 5
Invidious25,"Elden Ring (10/10 Masterpiece): The perfect game for a Souls Borne fan. Elden Ring delivered exactly what I was looking for in a new IP open world Souls Borne game. An interesting story, a great setting, and most importantly, kick ass combat. Souls Borne combat has never been better with a massive amount of build variety and varying combat options with the addition of horseback battle, spirit ash summons, and weapon arts. The game is absolutely massive with hours and hours of interesting exploration and punishing but fair boss battles. In terms of critiques, Elden Ring does suffer from a large, unexpected difficulty spike in the last couple areas and multiple repeat bosses, but these minor gripes pale in comparison to the sheer amount of content and hours of fun offered in this game. My most memorable moment has to be finally pushing through an extremely difficult optional boss’s health pool only to discover an equally punishing second phase. This is one of the best games I have ever played and one of the few that I had a hard time putting down to get some needed sleep.",10,2022-04-01,PLAYSTATION 5

perfect0zer0,"Some of the complaints from ""Souls veterans"" can be easily debunked. The graphics are maybe a 7/10 at best but the way FromSoft displays their art style that's been developed over the years, in this colossal world, really shines brightly. I found myself stopping at times looking around at the gorgeous view especially on top of large cliffs or mountains. The time of day changes can create different shots as well. The open world in Elden Ring is done better than most open world games today. That's what's considered ""Revolutionary"". They kept the souls-like feel despite going open-world which is more than what most game devs are able to do with their games when going in that direction. The way they reuse assets in this game is done properly. The world isn't littered with garbage and utterly useless items making the game feel repetitive (*cough cough Ubisoft games). Some of the bosses you fight early in the game become tough regular enemies later in the game making you as the player feel stronger and accomplished with the knowledge of how to defeat such enemies. The catacombs/dungeons are structured in a way that feel the same but each have their own set of enemies, traps, secrets, rewards and items. There's a reason to go into a specific dungeon because you may want that talisman, weapon, or ash. The recycling of assets in Elden Ring is done in a way that other developers should look at as an example of how to make a game feel fresh for 100 hours. The only other game that has done this well that I've played is Batman Arkham Knight I wouldn't call the combat boring in any way even if you've been playing Souls games from the beginning. I mean, maybe you're just bored of it? I'm not a souls veteran by any means but I have played Souls 1, Sekiro and now this game. There is a clear difference in scale and choices in Elden Ring. The amount of different builds you can design lets the player choose from literally 50+ options of how to play the game. You can look up builds on youtube as there are many literally just making builds for this game. I think this was FromSoft's way of adding more variety but it may have also added an ""easy mode"" as there are some builds/weapons that are considered by the community OP and an easy way of running through Elden Ring. (ie. Moonveil, Magic, etc) Overall, I highly recommend this game to any gamer. It is still difficult compared to your average RPG but will be worth the time and effort if you stick through it.",9,2022-04-01,PLAYSTATION 5
Labina27,"It's funny how most of the negative votes are for graphical issues, for an empty open world, and for its poor narrative level, something that is completely true. But FromSoftware has never stood out for the technical section, and has never pretended to, its beauty lies in the artistic and sound section, where it excels above any video game saga. Nor has it ever tried to tell its stories through dialogues, its lore resides in the objects you find and in the small conversations you find through its world with different characters, a different way of telling its stories that it has been doing since its beginnings, why would anyone expect that to change now? It's absurd. It's funny how in this way it manages to catch me and wrap me in the deep need to learn more about its lore, however in the rest of video games where there are hundreds of dialogues and cinematics they get me to disconnect automatically from the conversation, losing interest in its story. Finally, people expected to find a living open world, in the style of RDR2, Horizon FW or Zelda BOW, but they already made it clear repeatedly that it would be something very simple, something similar to Shadows of the Colossus, simply an interconnected open world, nothing more. I hope FromSoftware will never change their way of developing videogames, because once again, they have created a masterpiece",10,2022-04-01,PLAYSTATION 5

OllyNorton,"First things first, this is Dark Souls. Not Dark Souls in the way Bloodborne and Sekiro are, where they change up key gameplay elements to keep the game fresh, Elden Ring when not on a horse is just Dark Souls. I've always found that Froms gameplay evolutions in both Bloodborne and Sekiro (although I never completed Sekiro) were a lot more fun to play. They still had that challenge of Dark Souls but were just a bit more focused making the challenge a bit more amped up and harder to cheese. That said Dark Souls gameplay its still good, just not as good as other From gameplay systems for me. So let's take on the new elements. Chiefly the open world, it took me a while to appreciate it but it is very dense and has some really fun exploration. Although I really did miss the intricate, interconnected, world designs of older games. For much of the game it's a decent souls game, but when you reach end game bosses be prepared for some really boring fights. Souls bosses have often played by a rule set, like you they can't spam moves and magic because they would get tired or run out of mana. That is long gone in Elden Ring so be prepared to dodge infinite combos and magic coming your way until you get lucky and gap opens up to get in a hit and then back to rolling and dodging again. I didn't get a sense of satisfaction for beating any of the later game bosses, just merely relief. The game collapses here, where as the build up was souls with some decent exploration this end game is designed for only certain builds, If you roll a melee build be prepared for a boring/frustrating experience. I also don't find the lore as engaging as other From games, Demon Souls was this gothic bleak dead world and that spilled into Dark Souls that refined it, Bloodborne was an eldritch horror within a victorian city gone mad, Sekiro had an almost mystical vibe to it. Elden Ring is kind of meh, it's pretty in places and there are some awesome views but overall it failed to capture me quite as much as prior titles. None of these things are really bad, and are likely more down to my preferences really, but one things that is truly bad is the performance. foliage textures pop in about 20 feet in front of you, the frame rate shakes like a bobblehead on a washing machine during an earthquake, and a lot of the textures are pretty basic. Elden Ring has some great moments from it's art design, but as a technical piece its lacking considerably. (Played on PS5) I'm probably being a bit harsh on Elden Ring, it is a good game still, but I just preferred From's other games, and my fond memories of those titles just kept reminding me how I vastly preferred their tight interconnected faster paced games vs this slower, wider, rather loose one.",7,2022-03-31,PLAYSTATION 5

boredatMKE,"Elden Ring has one of the best stories I've seen in decades, like a dream come true for both Game of Thrones fans and Soulbourne game fans. If you enjoy old-school gaming like NES, Genesis, and SNES, Elden Ring is like those games on those old gaming systems, for example: 1. No difficulty setting. 2. You need to talk to other players to gain information about hidden treasures. 3. If you can't get through a stage, keep practicing until you get good at it. 4. Piss you off just the right amount so you will keep trying and have fun with it. 5. Not much hint was given to you, just explore and be amazed by every encounter.

Nate99,"Un juego que vale mucho la pena, yo lo pase en unas 109 horas y me pareció increíble que un juego de mundo abierto pueda darme tantas horas de juego de calidad antes de volverse aburrido o repetitivo. Pero el juego no es perfecto ya que sufre de algunas cositas que al menos yo pude ver a medida que lo iba jugando, como serían las siguientes: *Bajada de frames en ciertas zonas y contra algunos jefes. *Texturas que **** en cargar. *Los Bugs que tienen algunos enemigos, por ejemplo los perros del palacio de Moghwyn que te pueden matar en dos mordidas a pesar de tener 60 de vigor y armadura pesada. *Y el balance y reciclaje de jefes que hace el juego (para mí el punto más importante) yo conté cada jefe que mate y llegué a la cifra de 158 jefes de los cuales 80 son ""nuevos"" y el resto son todos repetidos con una skin y puestos en situaciones de 2 contra 1 o 3 contra 1, es como si el juego ya no tuviese formas justas o creativas de matarte. De los jefes principales la mayoría me parecen que están bien balanceados salvó algunas excepciones, como lo son Malenia y la Bestia de Elden, a mi gusto los peores jefes que a diseñado From. Al final todos estos detalles se terminan sumando y afectan la experiencia global de un jugador, en este caso la mía, y eso que no incluí el aspecto del online en mi crítica ya que no le voy a pagar a Sony el derecho de poder usar mi internet en su consola aunque el juego a jugar fuese Elden ring o Dark souls 4.

I will never forget Exploring Limgrave with nothing but awe and excitement. I already put 80hrs into getting the Platinum on my first playthrough.

The performance is rock solid on my PS5. The graphics, while not cutting edge, are adequate, and most importantly maintain a near solid 60 fps. The only downside for some is that this is a Fromsoft and the combat is punishing and requires patience and the willingness to learn. Two real world character traits that seem rare in 2022. The negative reviews strike me a coming from two groups of people. Group one is neophytes expecting another Skyrim. Group two is Dark Souls hardcore fans who want another Dark Souls.

Farore83,"This is my first review on meta because I just couldn’t believe the “0” ratings people were giving this masterpiece - yes masterpiece. Ok, I’ve heard about the “controversy” but I’ve completely ignored it and bought the game to see if it was actually good. I’ve been playing games since the 1980’s and this game stunned me. The first 30 min I was awed by the beauty and world design but fairly confused. I died some hundred times in the first hour or two. But as I got the hang of it and continued to explore I felt that childhood sense of wonder I haven’t experienced in a game for years and years. It just kept giving and giving - new terrifying creatures and gorgeous endless landscapes that kept unrolling as I went on. The sheer size of the world is mind boggling and beyond satisfying knowing you’ll never really get to explore everything. It makes it feel so exciting that you struggle to know where the world actually ends. But apart from the appealing open world, the actual gameplay is just a blast. Every enemy is a new boss to figure out and it never gets old finding creative ways to hack your way through a mob of baddies. I love trying out weapons and magic even when it gets overwhelming. It’s so amazing to get to play a game that gives me “Shadow of the Colossus” meets “Breath of the Wild” vibes. I haven’t been this addicted to a game since I was a kid. Anyone dogging this game either hasn’t really given it a chance, is a shill for some other company, or **** at gaming and isn’t interested in getting better.

Sick and tired of losing runes! Sick and tired of losing all my runes when attempting to retrieve my runes for only some enemy to come kill me. I’ve lost probably 1,000,000 runes all together from over 30 hours game play! Sick of it! Sick sick sick sick!! If they kept everything as it is but we don’t lose our runes would have been perfect.

hkjhkjh,I have never played a From Software game before but I gave this one a try since I heard it's more accessible thanks to the open world. Now I have putten over 100h into this game and have done almost everything in this game. Amazing game,10,2022-03-30,PLAYSTATION 5
Arshya80k,The game is really good but there is a major problem I have with is that without glitches and rune farms its takes so long to level up and finish the game. When progressing in the game bosses and enemies get a lot stronger and don’t even let me start with health bar lower than a eagle at the start of the game. I wouldn’t have a problem if levelling up was effective and didn’t actually need to go up to 100 to be able to fight a mid game boss. I spent 35 hours in the game just to reach level 50 no rune farms or glitches I couldn’t even if i wanted to cause the game punished me so hard by accidentally hitting the NPC at the start of game (white face). So I eventually got bored of the game because i either had to watch YouTube videos on how to defeat bosses on lower level or how to make my weapons stronger. And trust me it gets old pretty fast. No wonder almost all the players do rune farms and glitches it shows there is clearly something missing from the game everyone wants to finish the game in like 50 hours or something but you can’t even finish it after 100 hours if you not doing any glitch or rune farm. And thats what I call a waste of time.,3,2022-03-30,PLAYSTATION 5
Joraser,"Bestes Spiel was ich je gespielt habe. Das best of von FromSoftware mit der besten Open World die es gibt. Es gibt überall etwas zu entdecken und nachdem ich das Spiel 4 mal durchgespielt habe, weiß ich bestimmt immer noch nicht alles. Alleine wie die Karte aufgebaut ist, ist genial gemacht. Man schaltet langsam immer mehr frei und fragt sich die ganze Zeit wie groß das Spiel sein kann. Das Spiel bietet viele gute Waffen von denen man die meisten gerne ausprobieren würde. Die Bosskämpfe gegen die Demi-Götter wurden extrem gut inszeniert. Wenn man sich die Lore durchließt erkennt man auch wie durchdacht diese ist. Das Spiel ist sogar einsteigerfreundlicher als die Vorgänger. Wer eine Herausforderung sucht, kann im 1 gegen 1 gegen Bosse kämpfen, wer keine sucht, kann die Beschwörungen nutzen. Dass man Waffen aus einer Kategorie zusammen verwenden kann, ist eine massive Verbesserung im Vergleich zu Dark Souls. Ich könnte noch vieles weites aufzählen, was das Spiel alles richtig macht, aber es macht fast alles richtig. Selten habe ich mir bei einem Spiel von solch großem Umfang dennoch gewünscht, dass es noch weiter geht. Ich hoffe einfach darauf, dass es neben Dlcs noch eine Fortsetzung geben wird.",10,2022-03-30,PLAYSTATION 5

Pandur,"What i don't really get about all these low ratings here is how someone can buy a soulslike and complain about it's soulslike-style. Elden Ring is a soulslike in an open world. And while this is its biggest strength it seems to turn out as its achilles heel as well. 90% of users rating low argue like they expected the next epic, narration driven mainstream role-play-opera with accessible gameplay, an average or at least scalable difficulty and a somewhat cinematic approach to quests and storytelling. So maybe the real problem with Elden Ring is the extreme hype, making more casual gamers buy it for all the wrong reasons and certainly with the wrong expectations. And this is what lead to disappointment and absurdly emotional and negative reviews. However from an objective point of view a nine or ten is a thousand times more justified than any kind of review bombing. At least if you are up to a highly rewarding challenge and a pretty unique approach to open world gaming, giving you tons of options and challenges without holding your hand all the time. Or if you like well executed game mechanics, masterful artwork and: stunning visuals that are not outdated at all. If you're not, simply let it be.

Hagal,"I never buy a game without thoroughly investigating said title by reading and watching reviews from people I trust in these kind of things. And so it came to be that I bought Elden Ring, I have always wanted to play these games (souls) as their asthetics and atmosphere are of awesome levels but alas, I was never ""gud"" enough. But Elden Ring does what I thought could not be done, preserving those soulcrushing boss encounters, holding on to a general gameplaying that always asks ""are you awake?"" (else you pay for it instantly) and giving both selfhurting veterans and green privates like me a chance to experience this insane world of epic proportions. If a boss crushes you in a second, just walk in another direction and find strenght (and better weapons) and then return to crush him/her later! The open world structure of Elden Ring is truly well designed in a big array of ways, all from its core mechanic of classical soulsgame where you loose your mainresource with death which drives you forward to fullfilling your objects no matter how hard it may be. The world is also encouraging you to explore on your own, with your own eyes, instead of following a trail of glitter (no names mentioned). Rewarding exploration and hardship. One thing I truly love about the hardships of ER open world is that after numerous number of deaths and fails, you come out as this monster of a warrior, just traversing all of these enteties trying to kill you with ease, as the game has teached you (the hard way) how all of these works and fails. So in the end, even though everything is deadlly as hell, you can take it, because the game made you learn and evolve. The visual design is of the charts, it has been a long time since I got to behold such insanely great visuals/graphics, maybe not as resourceheavy as a cod-game, but top notch to the last fingertip. I have not encountered a single bug or glitch, nothing on the bad side. The game flows without framdrops or bugging out, cracy fast loading times.",10,2022-03-30,PLAYSTATION 5

His story, as always, is divided by reading items, actions, and scenarios, which will make more than one person not understand most of what is happening if he does not pay attention to detail.

Luarr,"Basically the negative reviews of the game are about technical problems, obviously frame drops is a bad thing, but honestly almost every game i played on ps4 is 30 fps so I don't care about that, the game rarely drops below 28 fps, or practically never, I must say that I haven't finished the game yet, I have about 50 hours on it, but even so I think most games these days would be finished or at least would be close to it with 50 hours of gameplay, my only complaint so far is that a boss bugged like 4 times and I had to reopen the game a few times, PvP never pleased me in any of the FS games either, always laggy, but I don't focus on PvP in this game so it kind of doesn't matter graphics were clearly never FS' strong point, and everyone knows that, but on a more artistic level, the game for me is perfect, it's like I'm inside a beautiful painting In short, I do think that technical issues should be fixed (for platforms that may need it, of course) but I think that as a Souls game, it perfectly fulfills its role and it's simply the pinnacle of the genre so far, it's worth it.",9,2022-03-29,PLAYSTATION 5

Oldboy1988,"I'm a massive fan of FromSoftware games. Bloodborne is my favourite game. A masterpiece. It was a game that i bought a ps4 to play and the game didn't match my expectations... It surpassed them. Just writing this post just makes me want to play Bloodborne again. Elden Ring got me all hyped. I bought a ps5 to play it and I'm sorely disappointed by my experience. I'm 90 hours into the game and it's boring. It's (excuse the pun) a soulless experience. This game suffers from what Metal Gear Solid 5 suffered from. It just didn't need to be open world. FromSoftware excels in tight level design. This is their first stab at open world and it shows. You end up riding around a dull world looking for action only to be confronted with too many bosses, many of which are lazily recycled. I'd prefer a smaller world packed with danger around every corner and less but more unique enemies. FromSoftware fell into the trap for open world games that more is better. I bought this digitally so I'm really pushing myself to finish it but after 90 hours in struggling. And not due to the difficulty. The game doesn't reward the players time. Empty, barren worlds with crappy gifts at the end of a dungeon or mini boss isn't fun. Bloodborne **** all over this game. I've been playing FromSoftware games since demon soul's on ps3 and (excluding ds2 and sekiro) this is my biggest disappointment. Dark souls 2 gets a pass because the FromSoftware B team made it and sekiro was an entirely different game with a few overlapping mechanics. Elden Ring could've and should've been their magnum opus but instead ends up as just another bland and repetitive open world game. The only difference being that it has harder enemies compared to other triple A open world games.",6,2022-03-28,PLAYSTATION 5

You can make the game easy if you want by getting overpowered gear and magic sorceries. Also there’s summons to help you with bosses. It’s up to you how you want to play it. There are tons of bosses that you can go after to get rewards to help you on your journey. From software(The Developers of this game) makes sure you are very well rewarded.

spinachspinach,"This game is incredibly hard to rate. The things that are good about this game are not just good, they are absolutely fantastic. But the things that are bad about this game are not just bad, they are downright terrible. In past souls games, there was always a delicate balance of risk and reward, regardless of the way you chose to build your character. In this game, a solo melee build only presents risk without reward, while most other builds eliminate all risks and just hands you the ""enemy felled"" text to you on a silver platter. The game is simultaneously too hard and too easy, and it just feels weird. Kind of reminds me of ds2 in many ways",7,2022-03-27,PLAYSTATION 5
Essun,"Elden Ring is amazing. To me, what makes it shine is the sense of mystery that stays fresh even after hours & hours of gameplay. I would compare it to Breath of the Wild, or the oldschool Elder Scrolls games of yore. The combat is also great and feels very visceral. It's fun to think of the perfect build, but ultimately it's an RPG and your character will gradually get more powerful over time. What really makes this game special is that every single area feels meticulously handcrafted, and you keep uncovering subtle game mechanics as the game goes on. Personally - I played it single-player without FAQing anything. I find the messages from other players to be more distracting than helpful. (Minor spoiler) My favorite moment thus far? Exploring the magic academy in Liurnia of the Lakes is gorgeous and surreal - I went down a strange elevator to be killed by a mechanical creature, and what?!

Major_Ripoff,"Elden Ring is mediocre at best. The perfect reviews are misleading and terribly inaccurate. This game is far from perfect! Elden Ring at its core is not next generation gaming. The graphics are diluted and look more like the product of a PS3 console. Gameplay is weightless in its execution and twitchy at best. The bosses are cheap hitting powerhouses that take way more effort to kill than they should. Dying over and over again is not my idea of fun. This is coming from a guy that is on his 8'th playthrough with Bloodborne so I understand what difficulty should be like. There's a difference between hard and cheap! The UI in Elden Ring is counterintuitive and clunky. From Software can learn a thing or two about how to manage your inventory through games like Immortals Fenyx Rising, Horizon and Ghost of Tsushima. The only thing that Elden Ring has going for it is the sound. That's pretty much it. Never again will I buy into the hype like I did with Elden Ring. I'd refund the game if I could, but I can't. Do yourself a favor and don't buy into the hype like I did. If this is the direction of From Software with its future releases then it's going to be a hard pass for me.",5,2022-03-27,PLAYSTATION 5

Elden Ring is an absolute joke compared to single-player mode of GTA 5.,0,2022-03-27,PLAYSTATION 5

TrueGamer_,"Assassin's Creed does open world million times better and sales show that as well. Elden Ring will never reach AC level. Elden Ring fanboys will never understand what actually good storytelling and open world really means. All they want is mindless copy+paste boss battles, but thankfully these people are minority. Gaming would be absolutely worthless, if there were only Souls type games. Most people wouldn't even care about gaming. Thankfully there's still Assassin's Creed, Watch Dogs, Far Cry, Red Dead Redemption, Skyrim, GTA, Resident Evil and other great gaming series left for people who actually have some Taste in gaming.",0,2022-03-27,PLAYSTATION 5
Splindif,"Terrible graphics, terrible level design, terrible menus, no quest log, terrible clunky controls, terrible lock on system, terrible rewards, not an open world just a big empty map, no playing with friends, no interesting NPCs, no fun just stress, terrible waste of time and money. You need a piece of paper to take your own notes, or you will forget what is happening. If you want an example **** open world take notes from RDR2 or the Zelda games. Fan boys need to play something else to see where we are really at in 2022.. Stop claiming a ps3 caliber game is GOTY. You literally have to watch a video of someone else playing it to know where to go or what to do. I didn't buy a game to watch someone else play and spoil it all for me. BRUTAL.

predator73,"Amazing game, I started off somewhat skeptical when I was first exploring the map thinking it was empty, but when I started really exploring I realised how much caves, dungeons and secrets are all hidden and waiting to be discovered. It takes the mechanics and gameplay of each from game and puts them all together and it works. Combat feels great especially when you start finding new arts of war, combined that with spells and the new mounted combat and jump attacks. It took me a slight adjustment period but I'm hooked. The world is huge and full of loot. The trademark atmosphere that's from soft games are known for is here which is impressive given the open world format. I'd highly recommend to anyone especially a fan of dark souls. Great universe and level design, creepy and interesting enemies and enemy encounters, exploration is rewarding and amazing and combat feels really good and very responsive. Maybe I'm gonna sound ludicrous, but as soon as I got to the open world (which happens pretty fast). Feels great! That sensation that there's is a vast world to explore and you don't know what you're going to find and how many times you're gonna get into trouble. This is a kust play gane for any Souls game lovers!!! Absolutely phenomenal. I think it's the freedom to get better and then come back to bosses when you are ready that attracts me. I have just walked out into the world, and wow, mind blown. Soulsborne games are not somethin u can get straight away and they mostly take patience, clearly everyone heard about the hype but didn’t bother to research. They have their own genre because they are niche, they were never meant for everyone. Any one who leaves a 1 star couldn’t get past the solider of godric in the tutorial or prolly didn’t even kno u had to jump down. Enjoy it at ur own pace, the thing that is great about these games is everyone enjoys them in different ways. And just anyone who respects beautiful games with heart and soul put into them. This game is exactly what i was craving!!! Love it. The story is very engaging and the battles are tough and take time to master like other soulsbourne games. FromSoftware has done it again. A must try game. Miyazaki went beyond anything the Elden Ring community imagined with this absolute masterpiece. He surpassed all expectations by bringing some of the most innovative of ideas, hence again revolutionising game design. ELDEN RING IS A TRUE MASTERPIECE! Tolga Özruh !",10,2022-03-27,PLAYSTATION 5
Parzival_89,"Elden Ring is too good to be explained. Literally i could go on for the entire alotted character length about how great it is. The gorgeous, wonderfully designed open world draws you in, rewards your exploration, and flat out drops your jaw! The characters and lore are so rich and well thought out, and the fact you have to go and discover it yourself to get the full picture makes finding out what and where and why such a wonderful revelation. Youll stop and just think, or stop and take in your surroundings, stop to just appreciate what a fantastic experience it is and the world you find yourself surrounded by. Finally a game delivers on the hype and over delivers in such a way it leaves me at a loss for a good explanation of how absolutely fantastic it is. Its like im playing a game im nostalgic for even though its brand new and fresh and right in front of me. For the first time in a long time i think about a game even when not playing, wanting to jump back in throughout the day.

PMG-Writer,"Thus, Bandai Namco Europe and FromSoftware have done everything right with ""Elden Ring"". The story can directly overpower you and keep you spellbound for hours. The beautiful environments and the pretty enemy types are also the highlight. In addition, the many possibilities with the characters and attack variants are convincing. In terms of gameplay, you get a damn heavy and challenging action role-playing game for the console and PC. In addition, further improvements and patches are planned.

FromSoftware has done it again. Although it does feel a bit too much like Dark Souls 3, and not enough like Bloodborne or Sekiro (they could have added more from those two spin-offs to make this game feel less like Dark Souls 4.5 in my opinion), Elden Ring still shows that this dev team has learned plenty from all of their releases over the last decade.",9,2022-03-26,PLAYSTATION 5

Cartman1452,"This game is a masterpiece. If you like the soulsborne formula, this game delivers and more. I don’t know why people are saying it had performance issue, it worked perfect on my ps5. Game was fun and challenging. Minor complaint is reusing bosses but it isn’t enough to drop game to a 9. For all you reviewers bombing the game, grow up. Saying “I don’t like souls games, and this is a souls game so it still ****” is like me saying I hate the sport of soccer so fifa games must ****. It’s pointless to say. I wouldn’t play rock band if I hate music, so if you don’t like challenging, obscure stories games, don’t play this. Also, in a world of microtransactions and corporate greed, you need to appreciate this game. I paid $80 and spent nearly 150 hours on my first playthrough alone. That is refreshing. So many games force you to pay to win, or pay to get any sort of enjoyment on top of the initial purchase and this game is not like that. I will spend hundreds of hours for $80 CAD. There aren’t many games like that anymore so people should appreciate it. It’s so refreshing to not be bombarded with microtransactions. Thanks FromSoft",10,2022-03-26,PLAYSTATION 5

CNRED,"Where to start? Fromsoft's beautifully made Souls-like is definitely impressive when it comes to sheer scale, and the world is awe striking, something many Western open-world RPGs often lack. The gameplay is similar to other Souls-likes: A near-religious commitment to realistic combat flow that requires one deploy their full arsenal of parries, dodges, and opportunistic strikes. It's this quality that has made Fromsoft's library so unique. But while Elden Ring offers the usual level of difficulty one would expect from Souls-like games, it also gives players a host of ways to cheese through its many difficult encounters. This comes from the ability to freely wander the entire open world right from the start. Players are able to traverse the lands and find weapons and armor that, while not totally eliminating the game's difficulty, make it much easier to advance. The game's steep learning curb make it semi-hostile to casual gamers. Anyone willing to learn ER's myriad mechanics, however, will adapt. Then comes the satisfaction of taking out a tough boss, after numerous tries, with only the skills you have available. This stick-carrot method to gameplay philosophy creates a satisfying experience. Now for the cons: As a more story oriented gamer, the obscure plot was somewhat impenetrable. This led to me sometimes wonder what I was doing and why I was doing it. Also, the post-modern bend, where every character you encounter tells the story in their own way, filtered through their own agendas, means that players are forced to not only imbibe the story being presented--they must piece it together themselves. This is an interesting design philosophy, and one that I believe is unique to video game storytelling. Nonetheless, finding a sweet spot between piecing the story together yourself and presenting a relatively consumable narrative should be Fromsoft's goal in future games to further mainstream success. There is, however, something to be said for game's that eschew mass market consumerism. Also, the world felt relatively dead. Because the setting is somewhat apocalyptic, I forgave the lack of town's, and the relatively low number of friendly NPCs. And about those npcs, can we get better writers next time? Absolutely none of the npcs in the game have any personality, and they all deliver their lines in the same awkward monotone. This is supposed to lend to the games dreary atmosphere, but it made the setting feel drab and boring, and that's unfortunate because ER is anything but. ER's world is beautiful and deadly. It would be better if it felt more lived in, too. All that said, this is a solid title. The game's design aesthetics feel very Japanese, and anyone who is into old Japanese action-adventure games, like Actraiser, will likely enjoy it. Fans of Souls-like games will, of course, love this edition to Fromsoft's canon. This game isn't for everyone, but if you're willing to learn its rhythm, this is a fantastic, massive (massive) game with tons of playability. An easy shoe-in for game of the year.",8,2022-03-26,PLAYSTATION 5

SunPraisinMan,"Playing on the ps5 version of this game was slightly better than the ps4 but stuttering and pop in are still a big issue even on the ps5. Even then the core game play is so mediocre. And it pains me to say it but this game is easily the worst from software game I played to date. I was so hyped for this game after it's reveal and after playing dark souls 1 and 3, bloodborne, sekiro, and even deracine, I expected this game to be the best part of all them. But if anything, they just removed the best aspects of their previous games, from the beautiful levels that were handcrafted to near perfection, elden ring just doesn't have that. The open world of limgrave although stunning to look at first eventually devolves into bland empty grass fields with groups of brain dead ai scattered across. It's not even worth fighting them due to how little runes you get after clearing them. There's also dungeons that are about as pointless to explore due to how uninteresting it is to explore with the final boss at the end just being copy pasted from other areas, honestly i don't get what's so special about the open world at all, if anything it drastically ruins the flow of the game. There's also static npc's you could find stand around all day and night barely moving to just spout exposition at you while you're character just stands there when you talk them. The core combat is fine but it's just dark souls 3 again which after sekiro feels like a big step backwards. Edit: Nvm just beat it and honestly wasn't too bad",5,2022-03-25,PLAYSTATION 5
Witchywoman212,"At first I liked this game. Graphics are good, but I believe From has gone down a bad road, starting with Sekiro. The From souls games were brilliant, and a lot of fun. Difficult, but enjoyable. I laughed a lot, and had fun with the coops and invasions. But this game has taken on a Nioh feel. Everything is one shot, and there is a kill switch, when you are in danger of killing a boss. I believe the pve is overpowered. Especially when you are trying to reach an important area to advance the game. I have had to respect my character two times to advance. This is not good game design. The Fire Giant is almost impossible. You can't finish the game without beating it. There is little help, and no mimic help. Why have a mimic when you can't use it in the most important areas of the game. The blood, and bleeding is way overpowered. Invaders can one shot you. There is very little defense against the most overused builds in the game. I got sick of fighting all the bosses with blood builds. I really wanted to give the game up. Now I played Nioh, and hated the game. I even platinumed both Nioh games. Has From gone so far to cheapen their games competing with the Nioh Team? I am not sure I am going to finish Elden Ring. They dumb down good weapons that let you complete with the overpowered and unfair bosses, but not the bosses. They need to look at the way people are struggling to get through. The NPC's that help are crap. I miss the good NPC's in DS2. One good thing, the horse. I loved it. The world is too big, and coop help is too scattered around the big world. The lines are interesting, but way to long. The Alexander Jar line is ridiculous. Anyway, if you decide to play, good luck! i wish From would go back to the winning ways of DS and Bloodborne.",7,2022-03-25,PLAYSTATION 5

Now i need to Dig for the other 30%.. most likely AT LEAST another 50 hours. there hasent been a game with so much content since RED dead Redemption 2 B)Elden Rings story is NOT forced down your throat. u have to EARN IT.. u Need to explore.. read item descriptions and talk to every NPC u meet MANY times.. all these people that say it has no story.. ARE LAZY.. or CAN'T READ... PERIOD C) Elden Ring has NO EASY MODE... the game is HARD.. invest some time and GIT GUD!! just cuz your terrible at it.. or dont wanna try... does NOT make the game a Zero out of TEN Bottom line.. this game is a CLASSIC and worth its 95 rating. people that say other wise are not objectively looking at it.. they are just mad cuz their computer cant run it.. or They are terrible at it.. once again.. in 2022 people are LAZY THIS IS THE GAME OF THE YEAR FOLKS, so sit down..

BUT THIS OMFG I was hooked from the get go, Yes it is Hard and has a steep learning curve but when it clicks it clicks, It took my 3rd Attempt to get into it but now I'm 70hrs in and loving it at level 136 (Astrologer) There is sooooooo much to see and do, Some areas are easier than others and if you find your struggling hit Rune Farming up on YouTube. I will keep coming back to this again and again as I always find something new each time I load up. The only reason I've given it a 9 and not a 10 is because the Path you need to take is a little confusing and can tend to end up in an area way to overpowered for your build. Other than that for £44.99 for the Launch Edition off Amazon it`s a steal.",9,2022-03-25,PLAYSTATION 5
PaleNielsen,Open world dark souls with a lot to offer. A lot of different unique bosses but some dungeon bosses are reskinned of some you've face before. Some weapons are quite overpowered really glad they patched some of it up. Exploration is fun and quite new to the soulsborne series. Some really great areas specially the areas underground. 1 story boss is incredibly stupid. Some spells are useless either they cost a lot of mana to use or the basic spells you've got the first time is just too good. Never encountered invasions of other players I'm not sure why. Probably one of the easiest soulsborne games to play and get started. tldr; it's good buy it lol. probably not as good as Sekiro or Bloodborne.,8,2022-03-25,PLAYSTATION 5
ArataLatam,"Elden Ring apunta a ser el lienzo dorado del año, cuyo retrato puede cautivar a nuevos guerreros sin luz. El combate no se siente antaño, ha crecido con las cenizas de guerra y otros añadidos para apoyar diversas construcciones. Hay clases para cada estilo, no importa si tu inspiración es el combate directo, la magia o un experimento funesto. Te depara un viaje de 30 a 40 horas, pero se amplía más si todas las gestas decides tomar. Es la obra menos difícil de la saga pero sin abandonar el desafío que le caracteriza, toda ayuda es opcional. Yo no era asidua al género, ni buena con la espada, pero su encanto me atrapó y lo he disfrutado. Review: ****/arata-review-elden-ring-playstation-5/",9,2022-03-25,PLAYSTATION 5

stormbeta,"As someone who doesn't normally like Souls-like games, I enjoyed this - it's basically Breath of the Wild crossed with Dark Souls. This is a perfect example of how to do open world exploration properly, and unlike past Souls games this one is much easier to workaround if you get stuck on the difficulty. I take a point off though because the game makes exploring different kinds of builds far more difficult than it should be, especially using different weapons which really undermines the fun of finding the hundreds of crazy weapons hidden throughout the game.",9,2022-03-25,PLAYSTATION 5

The game doesn't think that player is stupid, it feels challenging when it needs to and gives you feeling of progression when it needs to. I really liked AC: Odessey early game feature of defining next objective location by myself using mountains, rivers, cities as reference points (before upgrading drone-eagle). All ER exploration is about that. No need to rush through main story. If you see something interesting far away, then you should check it out. If you found new interesting weapon, then you should try it. Same for spells, armor and talismans. The game isn't for everyone, but everyone should give it a try.",10,2022-03-24,PLAYSTATION 5

Also, including coop makes it that much more fun playing with a mate. The customisation is awesome, everyone's build is unique. I'm constantly discovering new things and mechanics. Despite the story being hard to follow, it definitely draws you in and keeps you hungry to advance and see what is around the corner. I definitely recommend this to the new players. Killing bosses after numerous attempts is the most satisfying feeling that I cannot completely explain. 10/10",10,2022-03-24,PLAYSTATION 5

JustADude15,"It’s FromSoftware. Nothing new to see here. Likes: > Art Style > Lore > Depth of customization > Throttling of features / new mechanics to discover Dislikes: > Usual FS combat — Slow, with few inputs. Boss fights are a matter of memorization and trial/error. FS elitists will call it skill, but it’s no reflex test — all about memorizing hitboxes / what you can or cannot parry/block / understanding timing of dodge and lack of input cancelling > Do you like to play games by googling what to do at every step? This one is for you. Do you like to keep a journal to manually track your own quests — I’m glad someone’s providing that opportunity. I give it a 7 because the world they’ve built is beautiful, but if you’re like me the gameplay loop and dated engine will get old fast. Full disclosure: Beat a few bosses including Godrick pretty easily. Combat is hard unless you’re a souls vet or until you figure it out — then it goes from hard to boring. This is my opinion but I prefer combat extremes like the player agency provided through reflex-based action OR the calculated strategy availed by turn-based. FS is you observe and then strategize when you should utilize one of two options: “dodge or hit”. It’s just not for me, at least not as a solo experience.",6,2022-03-24,PLAYSTATION 5

ganisberke,"Elden Ring is a totally average game. Don't believe the trolls and the toxic community talk. Many people consider From Software to be the originator of the Souls genre. It actually has its origins in Nihon Falcom. Therefore, according to them, Miyazaki is a messiah. However, Miyazaki and the Souls team is still making the same mistakes. Objective problems: -Hitboxes are not good. There are times when it reminds me of the DS2. -Boss designs are very unbalanced. They didn't really work well with many bosses. -The game gets too repetitive. Open world exploration is nice, but it gets boring quickly. -There seems to be a lot of items, but in the end, a few items are the most useful. The game forces you for make to broken builds. Because some boss designs require it. All builds look alike. For example, more than half of even PvP uses blood builds. -Optimization is still not fixed and every update is getting worse. -Spells are powerful. Playing spell builds are more advantageous in many ways. -Camera angles are not good. It really causes trouble. When the number of enemies is high, you cannot control field of view. -Lore quality is definitely a controversial topic. However, it has the same lore in other Souls games. Only their names have changed. George R. R. Martin is just PR work. -Enemies are just based on nonstop spawn attacks with endless stamina as like most of bosses. -Many of the bosses repeat themselves. Most bosses are either the same or reskin version. -The hit feeling is not good. Especially the bosses don't even react properly to your attacks. -It has a toxic and cancerous player base. -Artificial intelligence problems. A real disaster. -It is a headache for some attacks in the game to pass through objects. Conclusion: This game is not a masterpiece. Not on a new ip. It's just Dark Souls 4 with open world.",5,2022-03-23,PLAYSTATION 5

Summoning in the game even with passwords and connections are terribly slow and unreliable and secondly FromSoftware hasn't addressed a fix to this even when it has effected so many players Including myself from enjoying the game with a friend. I am currently at a difficult boss and needed a helping hand, what happened was an error ""Unable To Summon Cooperator"" that can be many issues such as Internet connection or location of summoning signs however I've been trying for roughly 3 hours and multiple attempts spanning days and yet again no mention from the company.",8,2022-03-23,PLAYSTATION 5
Yee123,Captivating open world with something to do anywhere you go. The boss fights have great design features. They are very difficult however it’s an open world and the game encourages you to explore and level up to finally beat that boss. Incredible graphics. Some downsides are frame drops when loading into a world or getting attacked by a boss and no real directions really are present there with quest lines and how to find certain resources which lead to skipping them or looking up a video.

Everything in the game is polished to perfection, and I can only think of very few flaws, which are easily ignored. I agree that this might not be the game for everyone, but for a long-time souls players like myself, it's a realization of the dream we've always had to play a game that would perfect the formula laid out by Dark Souls. The majority of the criticism comes from new players whom imagined this game is the same as every generic open-world titles they've been playing for the past decade, only to realize it's entirely different the hard way. I don't blame them, the hype bandwagon was too strong. Now, onto the criticisms I have for the game: there are hardly any memorable soundtracks. Only exceptions I can think of are the Main Menu, Godskin Apostle, and the Dragonlord. I'm not saying they're not good - they're sometimes even better than what most other games offer - they're just not up to the standard of previous Fromsoftware titles. When it comes to NPCs, I always enjoyed how dreadful it felt to leave their conversation abruptly or without purchasing anything, whereby they'd proceed to badmouth you. They unfortunately removed this neat little occurrence from Elden Ring; this might just be my own personal preference. Bar the aforementioned criticisms, this game is perfection incarnate.

Swclark777,"Eh, I don't know what Kool Aid everyone's been drinking, but it clearly didn't work on me. This is an above-average open world game, but it isn't without its faults. Particularly notable are the repetitious use of dungeons and enemies that really start to wear on you during the second half of the game. The combat also is unrefined, with many bosses glitching out, one particular battle saw a formidable opponent getting stuck in a tree and spontaneously combusting. Moreover, as melee class, battle is entirely dependent on i-frames, there's a lack of responsiveness to the process of combat, that sees luck play more of a role than skill in that sense. Stranger of Paradise surprisingly does combat much better than this game. While I would recommend it, and I don't consider it too hard for the average player, I can't do so without at least acknowledging that it runs out of ideas in the later parts of the quest.",7,2022-03-23,PLAYSTATION 5

Even in non-boss encounters… this sets you up for boss battles whee your button presses are stacked.

Alvz9,"Luego de 60 horas jugando Elden Ring, puedo afirmar que estoy frente a uno de los mejores juegos que he tenido el placer de probar en mi vida. Quedando mucho contenido opcional que probar, y casi llegando al 70% de los trofeos obtenidos, quisiera destacar en primera instancia su extenso mapa, cantidad de enemigos (jefes y no jefes), y variedad de contenido; mazmorras, castillos, bosques, llanuras, lagos, costa, todo lo que sea posible de imaginar en un juego de estas características. Su diseño artístico es magnifico, y si bien el motor gráfico se nota ya algo desfasado a los tiempos que corren, no quita el espectáculo visual que implica posicionarse en lo alto de ciertas zonas para ver a lo lejos castillos, montañas, y sobre todo ese majestuoso árbol que cubre el total de las tierras intermedias. A nivel de jugabilidad no hay mucho que decir: es Dark Souls en su punto más alto, agregando accesibilidad opcional para quien lo necesita (cenizas de guerra y cenizas, áreas para invocar NPCs o jugadores online, y posibilidad de farmear experiencia recorriendo el mundo que se ofrece). Los jefes principales y secundarios ofrecen combates memorables, algunos un tanto injustos por sus mecánicas, pero al fin y al cabo un desafío posible de abordar con tiempo y paciencia. El juego es una celebración a la historia de los juegos de Fromsoftware, con referencias constantes a la Saga Souls, Sekiro y Bloodborne. Por último, quisiese destacar su narrativa, que en muchas reseñas ha sido menospreciada, pero que me parece de una factura notable. Muchos no notaron la influencia de George R. R. Martin en la construcción del mundo, pero al igual que en todo Souls deben ahondar más para encontrar lo que se quiere contar: traiciones, disputas familiares, y la sed de poder por quedarse con el trono son sólo algunos de los aspectos que se intentan narrar en esta épica de fantasía oscura (de hecho, no me sorprendería ver una precuela en formato videojuego o serie/película). Para quienes deseen disfrutar este aspecto, y realmente le importe la narrativa del juego, les aconsejo intentar relacionar a los distintos personajes, jefes, y semidioses del juego entre sí. En resumen, probablemente el juego del año, que me dejó muy satisfecho y con una angustia luego de haber completado el contenido principal y parte del opcional.",10,2022-03-23,PLAYSTATION 5

Skharl,"Hauntingly beautiful, expansive maps filled with terribly forgettable writing, stories and characters. This game is built not to be engaging but to force pissing contests among the hardcore players only staying engaged in order to continue bragging. For a game that was hyped about playing your own way, there's surprisingly little imagination regarding classes, gear, and available ply opportunities. In the end it just comes down to figuring out the best way to build a cheese strategy for each boss and rinse Nd repeat against forced encounters. It's a not a game it's an uncapped grind-athon side quest in another games.",3,2022-03-23,PLAYSTATION 5
TheOneOnlyGuy,"I was at first questioning if this game was going to be good or not since most of the newer games released in the past few years have been either rushed , lazy or flat out broken , but Elden Ring proves to be one of the best games this year. With the gigantic world that have hundreds of things to do , boss battles that are thrilling and amazing to beat , and the beautiful story that comes along. Elden Ring is a must play for people who enjoy soulsborne games and people who have never heard it. I've already sunk in around 115 hours and i've beaten the game a second time. I still saw new things that I've never seen before. An honest 10/10 for the game and congrats to the FromSoftware team.",10,2022-03-23,PLAYSTATION 5
ArthurMorgan200,"I think Elden Ring is an amazing game with deep interesting lore and obviously an amazing open world filled with dungeons and secret entrances filled with enemies with their own unique move sets and their own unique boss encounters. The weapon variety is a mad from sorceries to spells to great swords to bows and more. The story is surprisingly interesting and tells you very little about how to get there. Obviously this isn't for everyone the game doesn't even have quest log or a journal to follow you need to remember what to do and you need to find it. But the level design is not as good as it should be. It's still great but sometimes it is horrible. Trying to complete the frenzied flame ending was so stupid. You need to parkour down some tombs to reach the bottom where you can finally defeat the boss. Sometimes sites of grace are put in the worst places. For example the site of grace near where you fight Leonine Misbegotten is so badly placed it is unbelievable sometimes enemies hit through walls, sometimes the game crashes and there is pop-in everywhere. Rhadan has been nerfed at the time of writing which i hate because Radahn was always viewed as a big opponent and that the odds were stacked against you but now he's not. I beat him in one go when i was underleveled. Everything I've meantioned apart from the level design problems i believe doesn't take away from the game. It takes a while to get into but once you do you can't stop.",9,2022-03-23,PLAYSTATION 5

glypheye,"10/10 for the anti-shills review bombing this game over petty issues (thanks guys and **** totally and completely contaminating the user review process to the point that it is utterly pointless and utterly useless) that are far and away outshined by absolutely epic Souls-style gameplay, hide and seek open world design with quests that must be uncovered to be discovered and followed through to completion, intelligent diversification of the previously at times claustrophobic interlace corridor layout of prior Souls games, into one of the most unique and satisfying open world experiences ever crafted. User reviewers who are dropping 0's, 1's, 2's, 3's , 4's have completely lost **** worse, think they're being honorable in doing so. Quite the opposite, in fact. As for the minor graphical/performance **** age old adage ""gameplay trumps graphics"" is absolutely hammered home in Elden Ring. And, in spite of the ridiculously low scores trying to prove a point not worth proving, the graphics are very good. They aren't ""the ****'s not Ghosts of **** they are good. But any Souls player worth his or her salt, won't care about Ghosts style/level graphics/performance. That's never been what these games are about. It's about the art **** cryptic **** fantastical dark fantasy elements and entities that are straight out of a Salvador Dali fever dream. It's about the build and the weapons and the **** a world beyond one's conception. For those of us Souls lovers who have also been pining for **** bring in something fresh and challenging into the worn and thread-bare open world quasi-RPG adventure game genre.....Elden Ring is a colossal, shining-with-dark-light beacon.....a colossal, over-arching gold-white **** orient oneself around, wherever one might travel looking for hidden wonders in this perennially and compulsively wonderful and extremely dangerous world.

Mjmontgo,"I’ve never played a FromSoftware game before. Elden ring is a return to what gaming should be. No micro transactions. No pay walls. They’ve delivered an absolutely polished, fun game. I wish there was more cohesiveness with the story and lore to get you a little more captivated in the world. Sometimes it just feels like you’re going here to kill that “because”. But that’s alright, every other aspect of the game is basically amazing. I got exactly what I paid for. And I received more value and content than I had originally intended. With this being said, I haven’t seen a game come out where I was like “this is a masterpiece” since RDR2 and perhaps, The Witcher. I will be sure to keep an eye on future FromSoftware games and would recommend anyone who is up for the challenge - BUY IT. Is there issues? Yes. But in this day and age, this is exactly what I’m looking for out ****. Complete, no bs, beautiful landscapes, runs smooth on the Xbox series X. They delivered exactly what they promised (and more). For that I have to give Elden Ring a 10/10 and other publishers and developers should take note.",10,2022-03-22,PLAYSTATION 5

Darkon365,"So far, this is the closest game to what I dreamt an heroic fantasy D&D game could be. Yes hard but the open world allow you to level and explore even if you cannot beat a boss (to some degree). The game is beautiful, very fluid (PS5) except for some lag spike. Only true negative would be for the lack of help to novice players. I did not google it before buying and the start was very difficult, and I almost gave up. I had to spend hours on YouTube after that to learn how to play. The tutorial (that I missed at first) does not cover magic at all !! Yes if you had infinite amount of time, you can try and learn, but for real users with daily job, at least add some in game method to learn. It is unnecessarily made into an experienced users-only.

Cabe recalcar que no existe un modo facil, si no que son recursos que ofrece el juego para ayudarte con tu aventura. Los graficos que tiene si que es verdad que no es lo mas novedoso hasta la fecha en la saga souls pero se compensa que el diseño artistico que tiene y el diseño del mundo que son preciosos. Por ultimo por 60 euros de media que esta el juego de salida como casi todos de salida, ofrece probablemente de media unas 100h de juego, que hoy en dia es algo a agradecer.

The7thRequiem,"This is my first ever souls game I have ever had the will to play. I played DS, DS2, and DS3 for like an hour and stopped because I just felt like those games weren't made for me. Years later this gem drops and I have to be honest, I haven't been hooked on a game like this since Monster Hunter: World. This game is phenomenal, scary, beautiful, stressing, breathtaking, but most importantly.... FUN, which is something not a lot of games have nowadays. The world is expansive and so incredibly detailed. The weapons and armor look sick and the combat is really good, it kinda makes you want to master it since that is what the game is all about, fighting giant bosses. The target lock on camera can get a bit annoying if there are multiple enemies in an area but that's mostly a me type of thing. I have been playing for 55 hours so far and it feels like I haven't even scratched the surface of this game and I really don't want it to end. I really enjoy this game and I feel like this is perfect for newcomers like myself to jump in and lose yourself in the vast world of Elden Ring. It may look a little intimidating at first, but that is part of the challenge. That's what makes this game FUN, the challenge. That momentous feeling after killing Margit or Godrick or even the tree sentinel really gives you an indescribable sense of accomplishment, redemption and pride. Then you keep going, you're getting better, stronger, wiser, and more skilled and to me that alone really makes this game so FUN to me. This game has set a standard and I really do believe that this is my GOTY. I love you God of War: Ragnarok, but this game has really blown my mind. 11/10 Game of the Decade",0,2022-03-22,PLAYSTATION 5

bsokevitz,"I normally don't get on metacritic to post a review, but I adamantly disagreed with a lot of the negative reviews I've seen. I can understand that it might not be the game for everyone, especially if you don't enjoy exploring, but a lot of the reviews just seemed unfairly negative. I've played all the Dark Souls games minus Sekiro, and I believe Elden Ring is more than worth the hype that it's been given. It has these amazingly designed difficult bosses and less run-back time thanks to the Marika Statues that act as checkpoints. On top of that the world is absolutely breathtaking, not because the graphics are particularly amazing but because of how the world itself is designed and its artistic direction. The best part about Elden Ring is that if a specific boss feels too hard there are tons of ways to make it easier if you're struggling. You can summon a plethora of different kinds of summons or you can summon some people online to help you with a boss. In addition, if you don't want to do either of those, you can just go to a castle off in the distance, a cave or ruins marked on your map, or just let whimsy take you. This exploration when you get stuck on a boss you feel underleveled for helps alleviate some of that rage you built up from bashing your head against it over and over again. Either way, there are some minor flaws in this game, but I just feel that nearly all the design decisions for Elden Ring were amazing. I currently have about 180 hours into the game, and I'll probably put double that in before I put the game down for a break.",10,2022-03-22,PLAYSTATION 5

Need too much attention and we need to do a self database-like ourselves to get anything from this game ( or googling it, RIGHT.. That's really fun playing like that) .

Besides the imersion in this game is astonishing, i ended up losing the path i was supposed to take so many times and i loved every second of it It sure isnt for everyone, just like any other souls game, but for me it is a masterpiece, and a culmination of every piece of good characteristics the other souls games have, mashed up together",10,2022-03-22,PLAYSTATION 5

Movement or attacking feels laggy in a game that by all appearances should reward fast instincts.there is a huge input queue with no cancellation, so you're locked into the attack you pressed 1 second ago, even if the animation hasn't started and you try to do something else instead. It's buggy, but called ""hard"" instead. I could go on but the other reviews cover it, so I'll just summarize: In general there is no joy to the game at all.

More troll cheese from the devs, some baffling unbalanced bosses, etc. If you liked the previous entries in the de facto serial franchise.. you might like this one... just don't expect anything beyond what came before. The worst part is that this is a full price, supposedly AAA, game and the graphics look like they're from 7 years ago, the PC performance is inexcusably bad and LOCKED TO 60 FPS.

Daknedo,"Very buggy, can't even hit 60fps on ps5 steadily even though a game as heavy as Ghost of Tsushima runs at a locked 60fps with no loading time, this is very unoptimized. I die randomly at elevators, horrible grass pop in, dungeons and most other world bosses are copy and paste, game is hard in late game just for the sake of being hard, seems like From has forgot why people play these games. Sekiro and Bloodborne were their best games, and those games were difficulty done right. No matter how much of a tank you're, everything in haligtree and snowy mountaintops will 2 shot you. Enemies and bosses are designed to attack you as soon as you hit square to heal, crucible Knights will just stand there do nothing but as soon as you press R1 their hitting animation will start and they'll hit you first, it's just designed to F you over. I sound like a broken record but the game is difficult just to F with the player. It's unfair, you get gank boss fights in every corner of the game, they went back to dark souls 2 days where they put 500 enemies in one room and they call that fair difficulty. Godskin duo!?? Really!!? Seems like they ran out of time and were like ""aha! Let's put these 2 bosses in one room and call it a new boss, oh also. Let's make them self revive"". Also, this game **** on the face of every STR player , by making every strength weapons scale with either INT or FAI. Even if you get one of these heavy weapons, it'll be absolutely useless, because every late game boss is gonna be 100 times faster than you, rendering your STR build useless.

It has restored my faith in, not only RPGs, but video games in general. It treats the player as a grown-up and lets you create your own story, your own myth, in a world that rewards curiosity, bravery and ingenuity. It's not a game for everyone.

HailSatan,"250+ Hours. Nearly perfect. Why the 1 point deduction? - Graphics are good, but not up to AAA standards for Ps5 - Sadly, no real ps4 to ps5 differences besides performance - There is no hand-holding. For some players, this may feel cruel. - At times, solutions to roadblocks are so left-field it's near impossible without community hints. - Takes a solid 20-30 hours before progress feels fluid. Why the 9? - Best open world combat to date. You'll likely replay the entire game to try a different combat style. - It's huge. 250+ hours and I'm only now getting around to beating it. - Hard, but not as hard as other Souls games. You can get OP fast if it's your intention. - Secrets galore. The world is littered with breadcrumbs to sidetrack you in the best way possible. - Risk/Reward is balanced. When it's ""too much"", you're probably in the right place at the wrong time. - True gaming glory. No doubt you die a lot, but victories have never felt more fun and meaningful. TLDR : Minor performance shortcomings. A revolutionary take on the Open-World RPG and must-play for fans of combat/exploration RPGs.",9,2022-03-21,PLAYSTATION 5

Ask00,"Truly an incredible experience. This game is a mix between the tightly crafted and rewarding challenging Souls formula we've come to know and love and a sprawling open world with secrets and discoveries everywhere. I was afraid this would break the mostly-linear design of From Software's previous classic entries but it only strengthens it in my book, adding an entirely new layer and showing a natural evolution to the formula. You're let go almost instantly, with only a general pointer in the direction of the main story, but you'll quickly learn that rushing the bosses will be a grueling and punishing feat, encouraging exploration. While From Software, for some reason or another, still struggle with confusing UI and menu navigation for newcomers, this game is more beginner-friendly than ever before. No more is the solution to encountering a hard boss to just keep trying again and again for hours. Now you can do something else. Empower your weapons, get significant new abilities and ashes and much much more, but most importantly: gain experience. There are also a ton of different playstyles available of different difficulties, so while there might now be a difficulty slider, the player can choose differing paths to get an easier or harder time with the game. The story is pretty obscure, so unless you're willing to read and read and explore every corner of the world, don't expect to get a clear cut picture of the world you're in. My other main gripe would be the horrible performance on consoles especially and all PC players daring to put the motion blur on.",9,2022-03-21,PLAYSTATION 5

Nandi,"Technically game is not next-gen and uses forced chromatic aberration filter to hide graphical flaws. Lots of texture and mesh pop in, mostly on environments. A lot of enemies and bosses are reskins from previous games, same goes for the players character animations. In a lot of cases not only animations but entire models are simply copied from previous games (giant crabs etc). Mechanically game is identical to any soulsborne game, meaning controls (especially for keyboard & mouse) are inconvenient for 2022. UI is horrendous. Main bosses are forgettable and the world even tho it is open, feels empty or meaningless. Extremely large MMO buildings and areas - aka. exaggerated just for the sense of awe while inside is usually just an empty box. Soulsbourne cryptic type npcs work in linear games where you will meet them no matter what - these quest types are not fit an open world scenario. Music is uninspiring.

The freeroaming is truly satisfying, and you kind of make up your own story. This game is, however, a difficult, punishing one - as you would expect from FromSoftware. I personnaly don’t mind, if you know what you ´re facing. Unfortunately, the very dated gameplay and the unending bugs make your experience.. tarnished. You can sometimes spend several hours on a single non-boss enemy, whereas you would kill a boss in a few minutes. And that makes it very frustrating.

Anon11,"Don't believe the negative review bombs from the user scores. They are pissed off babies crying that the game doesnt have an easy mode. They are so accustomed and blinded by super easy, stale open world games with microtransactions like assassins creed that holds your hand 100% of the way. They are mad that they have to actually explore the game world and find things for themselves instead of just opening the map and choosing 1 out of the 100 repetative fetch quests or ""go climb this"" to reveal even more repetative fetch/collect quests. I can GUARANTEE that the people who are giving this a bad review raged quit at the first main boss because this is their first souls born game and have zero patience and skill to overcome anything thats actually a challenge. Once they died maybe 5 to 6 times they broke their tv and came to review bomb the game while breathing heavly and slaming on their keyboard keys. This isn't an ""inbetween"" game, you either loved dark souls or you hated it, and those who loved it will praise the game because they actually know what the hell they are talking about and those that have never played a souls game and claim they have been playing since demon souls are full of **** and are giving this game a bad review because this game wasn't for them in the first place and ALL souls games have ALWAYS been know for their extreme difficulty.

Zski,"For full transparency, I never liked any of the other Souls games. This is my favorite of the Souls games that I have played. This is because the game feels easier, with many battles being optional and the open world allowing for stealth approaches, so it’s more welcoming to people who aren’t diehard fans like myself. The open world definitely makes this the most accessible of all the games, and the way they drop you into the open world with minimal guidance or objectives is very cool. The game forces you to explore which is a pleasure because the world is beautiful. I also like how they encourage natural exploration and curiosity unlike other open world games which flood your minimap with 20 different icons. The game really shines in the aesthetic design of the world and it really feels like it captures the dark fantasy theme, especially the color palettes - the first area has the green colored skies and the golden colored clouds, it almost looks like a metal album cover. The world really is visually stunning, and with each additional section of the map that you uncover, you begin to realize how vast and varying the environments are. The game has interesting lore, but the very spread out story and lack of opportunities to learn more about the lore just make it a visual experience. Even the rare NPC that yoy come across doesn’t really offer anything of interest. The graphics are good, and really add to the intrigue of the world. While it is beautiful and has interesting lore sprinkled throughout, it feels like a bit of a boring world. It’s big, it’s empty, the enemies are randomly scattered throughout, but there isn’t much substance there beyond the visuals. There are few random NPCs, and if you find any, usually it’s one person standing in the middle of nowhere. I do love the aesthetics of the world, unfortunately it’s just a bit of an uninteresting world because it’s rather empty and the lore is way too spread out. The sound is terrible - limited music, repetitive sound effects, generic ambient noise, it’s almost necessary to listen to a podcast or music when you play this game. One thing I always hated about the Souls games was the controls, and there are no different here. It always feels like it’s lacking any fluidity and it feels very rigid, and I don’t understand the praise Souls fans give these robotic motions. Even the button combinations are very confusing - even after ten hours of gameplay I still do the incorrect input during the heat of battle. The AI is also brick stupid, enemies will stop in their tracks to look at you, and if you step back, they just continue following their assigned path. The only major issue I had with the game was that it explains so little, I felt that I had to spend way too much time on Google figuring out how to do something simple like equip a spell. The entire game has a long learning curve - I didn’t care for the first 5 hours of the game at all, but when it clicked with me, I started enjoying it. All in all, I enjoyed the game more than any of the other Souls games, and I generally disliked most of the others. Adding the open world to the Souls formula was a necessary change to capture a wider audience like myself. I’m hoping future Souls games keep the open world. While the game is nowhere near as good as Breath of the Wild, it does replicate similar feelings of exploration, which I don’t think many games have captured. It’s a good game with a lot to offer, but to call this a perfect game is simply inaccurate. It’s big, it’s beautiful, it’s empty, and it’s clunky. EDIT: I left my same review up but increased the score from a 7 to an 8. It finally clicked with me. Still not worthy of anywhere near the 97 critic score, but it’s a great game. The bread and butter of the game is its ability to sow natural curiosity and exploration. EDIT 2: I have never revised an interview once, let alone twice, but I felt compelled to increase the score from an 8 to a 9. The learning curve is brutal, but once it clicks, it’s fantastic. The world is much larger than I initially expected, and I want to continue seeing what more there is, especially since I know I’m nowhere near halfway through the game. Unfortunately I don’t think I’ll ever give it a 10, the narrative is weak, I still find the controls to be cumbersome, I still find the world to be a little too empty. But this game really did blow me away.",10,2022-03-20,PLAYSTATION 5

Flabb,"This might be my favorite game of all time, I am a big fan of From Software games and this is the next evolution of the dark souls formula. This is not a game for everyone, if you dont like the soulsbourne series this game might not be for you, these games are obscure by design but if you find that difficult and irritating I would recommend you to look up a beginners guide on youtube and you might just start to enjoy these games. This is not a game where you follow mindlessly a waypoint and get everything spoonfed to you, the game goes out of its way to hide its content. You are activly exploring and looking for clues and the game does an excelent job leaving breadcrumbs for the player to follow and this makes uncovering said content very rewarding. Here is one of many examples: At the time of writing I uncoverd a huge underground dungeon in an area I had already been through, I just went back to kill an optional boss, looked around for a bit, saw an item i could not reach, went looking for the way to said item and ended up finding a huge area hidden away. You are in other words really rewarded if you are a curious player and somewhat of a detective. The world is beautiful with awesome music. When I was nearing demigod nr. 3 I stopped to enjoy the view and the gorgeous music for a while. This is truly a masterpice and I hope people whom are not into the difficult and obscure games of From Software will give this a chance. The difficulty of these games are really the learning phase, but once you get the hang of them they are not a joy! The difficulty gives you a fealing of dread when you are venturing into the unknown, embrace it. I have been playing this game on PS5 and I have sometimes experienced fps drops when I am riding in forrest areas, but nothing that has been game breaking.",10,2022-03-20,PLAYSTATION 5

AlviRafid,"I love this game. It feels like Hidetaka Miyazaki and his team put everything they learnt from making other souls game and applied everything that was good about them into one game. It shows George R R Martin wrote the script for this game. Even though the story is vague as expected from such games, whatever is there is full of depth. The bosses are exceptional. Even though you’ll die a lot but when you overcome a challenge you’ll be exhilarated. I like their take on open world games. I feel like from now on every other open world game that is going to come out it will be compared to this game. I like instead of going semi open world (linear) souls like games it went full open world. Instead of telling you what to do, it just leaves you be yourself and explore. No overcrowded UI. Instead of crowding the UI with unnecessary stuffs it lets you enjoy the beautiful world they created. Even though there are some improvements that could’ve been done, but I feel they did an exceptional job. I am looking forward to more games like this.",9,2022-03-20,PLAYSTATION 5

DeepThots,"As close to a 10/10 game as I’ve played in years, I never liked Dark Souls as it seemed needlessly hard but I really wanted to give this game a try. I came in to the game with the mindset that there would be pain and death and to learn from it, and I am loving it. The size, scope and attention to detail in this world is truly incredible, you can run in any direction and run in to something incredible. It is tough, challenging, dark and downright infuriating at times, and it is a bloody masterpiece. I have barely scratched the surface of this game, and it has been a long time since a game has captured my imagination the way elden ring has.",10,2022-03-19,PLAYSTATION 5
stormsword7,"I steered away from the Souls series for a long time despite the beautiful graphics and design, on account of the brutal reputation for difficulty they had. For this game, the marketing said that this game would finally be accessible to the average player. That was a deliberate and sadistic bold faced lie through and through. I have played a fair distance into the game and put up with many challenges, but eventually there comes a point that expecting the player to have millisecond reaction timing to overcome superly one sided fights is absolutely disgusting in terms of the gameplay design. The pacing of the levelling up is terrible after the beginner areas. The distances between the save points to the hardest areas of the game are unnecessarily long. Bosses and challenge opponents will suddenly have unbalanced countering range and abilities that are unavailable to the player. Overall, this game is a bait and switch for making content accessible to the wider audience. I agree with the many reviews on here that it entirely does not deserve the 10 out of 10 praise that so many are giving it. I acknowledge that so much of the content was beautifully created, but so much of it is locked behind a rage wall of gameplay. Do not waste your money on a console version. There are beautiful designs and content to enjoy, but it would probably be done better on PC in order to install mods to level the playing field as long as you don't care about multiplayer.",0,2022-03-19,PLAYSTATION 5

You could spend over an hour trying to complete a dungeon and get nothing as a reward. I bet that if this game came out from an unknown publisher it wouldn't get a 96 rating which is way too high.

bassistheplace2,"A fantastic game overall and a very unique take on the open-world action-RPG genre. That said, I do not believe this game was well optimized for next-gen consoles, especially the PS5 in particular. This was the only game I voluntarily played in quality mode (30fps) for a majority of the experience due to the semi-frequent frame drops, and I'm spoiled rotten by high framerates. Also, I would've loved to see the DualSense's features involved a little more in the experience, a la Demon's Souls, such as the adaptive triggers and more haptics. Although I can't ignore how well the SSD works in loading a massive game like this lightning-fast, which especially makes (frequently) dying feel far less of a chore, albeit with some major pop-in every now and then. Nonetheless, the gameplay and design of the game itself are nothing short of amazing and very smartly designed, although I can name a few bosses which relied a bit too heavily on RNG and luck to properly manage (e.g. a certain endgame boss's snow attack, and a gank boss in a mid-late game underground area of Limgrave). I also LOVE how forgiving the checkpoints are before most bosses and major encounters, which IMO, is a massive improvement from past Souls games, especially DeS. Nonetheless, like a majority of people, I strongly recommend this game for Soulsborne newcomers or those who found the past FromSoft games too challenging, but still, know what you're getting into and as everyone says: git gud.",9,2022-03-19,PLAYSTATION 5
jgeurts,"Elden Ring is an RPG that builds on the from soft formula that they have been building for years. Although this instalment does not drastically change the gameplay, the additions to the mechanics and improvement of aesthetics are more than welcome. Elden Ring at it's best is an incredible action RPG that does not forget what roleplaying means. You can start the game as whoever you want, and that doesn't restrict who you can become in any way. Quest-lines give you choice in a way not seen in the dark souls series prior. The open world is non-restrictive and the land is intricately connected to the lore and the history that has been built to give you an idea of the care and detail that has been built for this game. The lore and the world have been so intertwined that learning something about the lore will 9 times out of 10 add to your ability to play the game. The difficulty and freedom, however, are not for everybody. This means that many of the characteristics that are purposefully part of the game may be seen as bad, or aversive to many who don't click with the gameplay, freedom, or storytelling. Although everyone's likes and dislikes are valid, this does mean that this game is not for all audiences. This is perfectly ok though, as it does not take away from what has been accomplished in the release of this game.",10,2022-03-19,PLAYSTATION 5

Not a single second I am feeiing this is a fromsoftware game, they never design such one-shot kill system in the past but in this game its everywhere, fully reflecting they just didn't spend much time to balance the difficulty settings, which considered they already had so many boss almost direct copy and paste from previous dark souls game, is beyond acceptable. The combat mechanics is also bad that its simply not fun and not challenging but totally unfair, not withstanding the fact that lagging and unresponsive input that is hardly accpetable as a ps5 game (I finished nioh2 with platinum so dun argue with me I am not good enough, this is simply not a well designed and configured game). I dun know how anyone could put higher than 6 in this game. The only thing perhaps make ppl think this is good game is probably we haven't had a fully open world ARPG game like skyrim for too long.

We live in times when people are voting being manipulated by the majority, 0 credibility!

If you are not a souls fan and you are jumping into this game it's a 70% chance you might hate it, the gameplay has an pretty standard mechanic, roll and hit. The graphics are not next gen by far, a mediocre 4/10, as for the story where George RR Martin came as a savior for this genra, well it's like the last season from Games of thrones - epic fail. Wrap all these together and you get yourself a Dark souls 4 game with an open world, where everything is gloomy, dark and depressing, and there you go, you have Elden ring.Cheers to those Souls fan who keep this trash so highly rated Judge by the fan base people will vote this crap even if it's literally a",1,2022-03-19,PLAYSTATION 5

Xroud,"It's a good game, but it has a ton of issues. The bosses, the visuals the atmosphere are all great as usual, very distinct very interesting, combat is fun as always, the rpg elements are expanded greatly and there are some great quality of life improvements as well. But the open world is a huge miss in my experience it's great in theory and sometimes it really WOWs you, but it's also full of emptyness, copy paste dungeons and many more bugs than usual. It also causes this weird dynamic where you have to guess if you're the right level for each given encounter even on the main path which causes a very weird difficulty curve. The game also has pretty long walk and loadtimes on death. These 2 together waste so much time, you either commit to practicing the boss with sometimes minutes of downtime between attempts or you go and grind on the side. It's not difficult, it's tedious. The game also gives you a ton of tools to help you deal with bosses like summons upon summons, crazy spells, ashes and weapons etc which makes the game feel even less consistant in difficulty. There are also technical issues like bosses freezing up, constant stuttering, floor disappearing, map not loading, very long loadtimes, hit detection issues, crashes, dying upon reloading your save etc. I feel like fromsoft games started going in the right direction with bloodborne and sekiro, but elden ring takes a very different angle. It feels like where bloodborne and sekiro cut fat off and refined the formula, elden ring just put it back 2 fold. It's still a good game and it's going to entertain both souls fans and people new to these games, but I think the issues are pretty big and warrant a high-mixed review.",7,2022-03-19,PLAYSTATION 5

I've never noticed how open worlds can just be full of fetch quests and marker to marker traversal until this game actually made me take in the surroundings and interact with the world by remembering the locations I'm too underpowered for. Do I need to repeat the same hallway 1,000 times because some knight can swing an overpowered sword 896 degrees regardless of which way I roll across the floor? Probably not.

Zbju,"I barely ever write reviews, but felt the need to leave one for this game. The reason for this is not that I want to tank the game; far from it. However, I bought this game strictly because of its absurdly high critics score and ended up spending 100$ on a game I would not have bought had I known it was just as inaccessible as classic Souls games.. Indeed, even if I am not generally a fan of the Souls like genre, I assumed that a nearly perfect review score meant that this was a game for everyone. I was severely disappointed Now, it's not that I instantly dislike any game from this genre. I LOVED Star Wars : Fallen Order (can't wait for the sequel) and I had a love/hate relationship with Returnal (loved the story and concept but thought the frustrating gameplay was unnecessary). Elden Ring started out fine. Being an RPG fan first and foremost I loved the character customization options, as well as the diversity of classes, stats and skills (even though it is a lot to take in all at once). The story is intriguing at first, as the opening does not give you a lot of information but does seem to set up an interesting premise. The disappointment, however, essentially started there for me. You venture out into the world, with no real story narrative. I roamed from one uninteresting enemy group to another, simply grinding to get stronger. This grind is incredibly tedious as combat with your average enemy is often monotonous and repetitive. Played the first boss, got killed 10 times straight, barely bringing it lower than 30% of its health. At this point I ask myself: is it the inherent difficulty of the game or is it that my character is too weak? In doubt, I venture back into the open world, grinding through boring enemies for a few hours before coming back to the boss. I try it 10 times more, exact same result. I go back to grinding for a few hours, and finally completely lose interest. This game REALLY wasn't for me. Now I really do understand that, for hardcore fans of the Soulslike genre, this might be the perfect game. Quite obviously, most review sites clearly handed the review for this game to the most hardcore of these fans they had on staff, which explains the scores. However, most gamers are not such fans of the genre, as it does have a very particular style that is not everyone. I wouldn't call it ""niche"", there are too many for such a restrictive term, but we are far from the generalized popularity of more classical genres. Therefore, the review I'm writing is from the perspective of someone who is open to the genre, but not necessarily a fan of it.. The 6 I am giving this game is mostly for its visual qualities. I love the setting, the attention to details, the ambiance. You really feel as tough you are transported to another universe. I, however, did not enjoy much beyond that. As I mentioned before, combat, to me, was either way too hard or too easy, ultimately becoming uninteresting on either ones of these extremes. I usually don't mind banging my head against a difficulty wall until it breaks if there is motivation to push though. However, the narrative is so thin that I wasn't engrossed in the story, and, actually, the hours of getting killed and doing boring world fights dilutes it even further as the few narrative parts are stretched farther and farther away. To me, these games should have two scores. One for fans and one for the rest of us. I guess give it a 10/10 for fans, but, t me, it barely made 6/10. I would say don't buy if you're not really sure.",6,2022-03-18,PLAYSTATION 5
tmldan,"Tons of quality of life issues, performance is poor (tons of FPS drops on any platform), pop-in is all over the place and the world feels pretty empty and co-op is broken, graphical fidelity is also poor for 2022. Why can't from soft just allow people to play together consistently, this isn't 10 years ago where this was acceptable, the network is broken and co-op is just a pain in the ass. Over the years being a huge souls fan, i've been lenient with From Soft and hoped they would improve upon many things but they refuse particularly because reviewers are too nice to them. They deserve criticism not 10's. Anyways, this feels like dark souls 3 but open world, the world is made well but this is not innovative and feels samey.

BlueAmbers,"This is by far the worst game I’ve played in 25 years. I am level 105 and put 80 hours into it. I’ve only played this long because I am stubborn and didn’t want to spend $60 on a game and not complete it. Playing this game is like intentionally joining a multiplayer lobby full of hackers/aimbots in a game like call of duty. It’s an extremely unfair, frustrating and often futile experience. Do not play this, especially if you have anger issues. Also let’s not reward Sony and the multiple corrupt game journalists who gave this a 10/10. If you’re looking into this game because of the lore, be aware that it’s a bait-and-switch scheme. The lore is incoherent, badly explained, and the very rare NPCs you can interact with do not even move. You should only buy this if you enjoy : - Getting killed by almost every enemy in the game in 1-3 hits, no matter your level/armor (not exaggerating) - Being forced to roll/dodge/block multiple combos from bosses before you can safely hit them a couple times, and repeat this 100 times because bosses have 30x your health. - Unforgiving roll/i-frame timing, with zero reward for getting it right since almost every enemy attack is part of a combo that can change randomly - Even more unforgiving timing for parrying, with a janky stagger to critical hit QTE which does not trigger half the time. Furthermore, it's not clear which attacks can be parried. I guess the devs expect you to die 50 times per boss to find out for yourself, seems to be their plan for pretty much everything in the game. - Absolutely laughable collision models which will cause you to miss enemies that you literally can’t get any closer to (for example because their foot prevents you from getting close enough to hit their stomach) - Dying to hits/slashes/strikes that missed you by 6+ feet (not exaggerating, i have multiple videos of that happening), or that have lingering hitboxes for 1 second or more, even on non-AoE attacks - Balance that’s all over the place, you’ll constantly swing between thinking you’re overleveled, crushing everything in your path, and suddenly the difficulty level will explode, leaving zero room for error (and enjoy spending 1-2 minutes running back to most bosses between each attempts) - Pathetic and confusing UI and ergonomics, especially when it comes to the map, menus and descriptions. Also, I want to point out that i tried writing a more detailed review of why I disliked the game. 3500 characters, but Metacritic kept rejecting it with a 404 error.

I love it when it starts to rain out of nowhere + Better checkpoints before boss fights (For the most part) - Even by Souls standards the story is really incoherent - Too many asset flip side bosses and dungeons which is a by product of the world being needlessly huge - Progression is slow to incentive you to explore but because of the above it gets really tiresome and repetitive fast so thank god for exploits - Many times the difficulty corelates to what a cheap jumpscare does for a horror game . It gets the job done but it's artificial (Bosses spazzing out , aim bot , gank squads , one shots etc.) - Jankiness , input delay , poor clipping and bad camera during large scale boss fights - Frustrating without a guide especially when it comes to quests and knowing where items are - Too dependent on farming , meta items and ashes of war to carry you . This was true in past games as well but it never felt like a requirement In both a positive and negative way Elden Ring did nothing that I did not expect and unsurprisingly people twist the games negatives into positives like they always tend to do . It also suffers from the exact same issues Dark Souls 2 did , the open world did nothing for me personally and in case you gave a rats ass no I don't consider Elden Ring to be a masterpiece but in a sea of garbage nowadays it sure appears like one",8,2022-03-18,PLAYSTATION 5

mmaize,So much hype so little difference from any other souls like game I've played outside of the graphics (marginally better) and bosses. As had been said before if this was Dark Souls 4 it might have made more sense but the professional reviews here are just people trying to live up to the hype train which seriously under delivered. This game brings nothing new to the table it's just an updated rehash of things we've seen before.,4,2022-03-18,PLAYSTATION 5

LucidDream83,"This is one of the best games I have ever played. The scale of the world and amount of content is unmatched by anything out right now. The game punishes you for not preparing, never holds you hand, and allows each player to craft their own path. I was amazed at how much different our characters were when I played co op with friends. We all took totally different paths and found our own unique weapons and gear along the way. Do yourself a favor and play this game blind without looking up guides. It takes a lot longer but far more rewarding in my opinion. I’m 100 hours in and still haven’t seen the entire map. Do not listen to these 0 scores, these are salty gamers that didn’t put the time in to learn and get good at the game. Even if the game is not your style, you have to admire the masterpiece these developers created.",10,2022-03-18,PLAYSTATION 5

Ilovepandas9,"Wow, Fromsoft yet again stepping up the game again with this genre defining title. Were initially i was feeling quite skeptical about the open world, however it sold me when I reached the first of many legacy dungeons. the combat shines again, maybe less refined than a title like Sekiro, however still holds its own above most others in the genre. The level design in the legacy dungeons is carefully thought out and expertly organized in a interconnected maze, however the smaller dungeons often leave me wanting a better system. The Boss fights again are amazing, showing off a wide variety of designs and styles, however the repeated bosses and ""gank"" bosses often are frustrating, to what otherwise is almost a perfect experience. The visual design is again at times breathtaking, however its not the best looking of the ps5 generation, however more than passable! This is probably the most accessible of the Fromsoft games, with the most options ever for newcomers (Use magic ;)), and this is probably why it has gained the biggest following yet for a Fromsoft game. Would definitely recommend for people curious or interested in the series but have always been to nervous to try!",9,2022-03-18,PLAYSTATION 5

SpicyView,"I have never beat Souls/borne games but this one... After 133 hours of gameplay I have finished it and can finally say F.U to the Lord of blood…. Elden Ring is very immersive, you are in an awe with those majestic looking vistas. The character designs in this game are very well done, it kinda reminds me of Castlevania but has a punishing difficulty. The game is very difficult I think this is the most hardest RPG’s that I’ve play yet. It takes a lot of your time grinding you character to farm runes. Runes serves as currency in the game but also serve as experience to level your character. The game wants you to be patient and calm but sometimes those nerves will really get you, specially when you keep dying from an enemy/boss or an obstacle. Exploration is really what’s good about this game you can find more hidden secrets and areas just by exploring. Also there are no markers to the next destination for the main story line , I have to go search a wiki out of it just to finished the story. This game isn’t perfect it also shares annoying technical issues with other games like the camera. -The camera is one of your enemy when you are locking on to a target specially big ones it creates a weird angle that you can’t see enemies poise or the stance what strike it will do. -Another one is the wall, enemies strikes sometimes can pass through a wall, even if that enemy is behind the other side of the wall, like your hit box is really wide that walls cant stop enemies from hitting you. -Lastly and the most annoying is the delay response of controls whenever you are dodging and rolling or jumping specially when you are locking on to a target it sometimes doesn’t do what you want to do whether to dodge or jump or worst it gets delayed when you suppose to hit the enemies opening but your character keeps rolling because of the delay. I have a love and hate relationship with this game sometimes I just want to give up, because some certain enemies are annoyingly difficult. I almost broke my keyboard because of rage. If you want to play this game and you are up to the challenge. Here is a tip , magic spells or attacks are OP in this game, during my playthrough I build my character as a battle mage I used every weapon or magic spells that I could find that has more damage just to beat this game. Also read a wiki if it doesn’t really hurt your ego.",9,2022-03-18,PLAYSTATION 5

MakkeMakuttaja,"Elden ring has truly taken me in its firm grip. I don't even remember the last time a video game has had that effect on me. Maybe Skyrim but that's besides the point. Elden ring takes the good stuff from previous From software titles and adds on it. The open world works incredibly well and the game never loses that which makes a souls game great. Elden ring can be extremely difficult but so rewarding. And if you get frustrated it's easy to go do something else. Controls feel like dark souls 3 and that's a good thing in my opinion. If I have to find some negative aspect, the dungeons can feel a bit repetitive. All in all, I would say this very well could be a game of the decade. Easy 10/10.",10,2022-03-18,PLAYSTATION 5

arthasmenethil8,"EDITED after 108 hours of play time: Besides some little performance issues on PS5 which are now fixed, I'd say that this game is okish: exploring is rewarding even thou the enemies are repeated too often, some sub bosses are fun but they are the same ones you already faced over and over in the ****, it's fun to roam around and discover new things but after a while youìve seen it all. Regarding the""real"" bosses of the game, some are ok but others are utterly broken: bad hit boxes, their damage is just insane no matter how ""good"" or protected you are, oh and they can be easily broken by using a magic build with comet Azur + mimic ash +10.

Janiso,"Well, after 88 ingame hours and finishing the game yesterday, I think I have fair grounds to review this game. Firstly, my only 'soulsborne' games I played before Elden Ring are Dark Souls 3 and Demon's Souls remake. What I liked about those two was that it felt really refreshing and just something new/different from the usual AAA games. The open world RPG genre came to a point where every game felt the same. '?' markers on the map to tell you where to go, being spoon fed the lore with 30-40% of your playtime being dialogue. Quest logs that felt like you were ticking off your laundry list. Generally, being held by your hands the entire time. Soulsborn games just throw you into a world and let the world do the talking. You discover the story all by yourself by pieceing together the things you see and find. Whenever you find a NPC that talks to you it's something special and you cling to their mouths. Elden Ring takes this formula and improved it even more by letting you decide where to go. Every area is filled with dungeons, caves, ruins that tell from a time past. When you encounter an enemy you can't defeat you can always come back later and not be stuck there like in prior Soulsborn games. The combat style is very unique and challenging. You decide if you want to be the big tanky guy with a big hammer that can take some hits or be the agile dual-wielding katana guy that slashes through enemies. Or a Sorcerer that wields powerful spells and attacks from a distance. So many possibilities to choose from. I've seen a lot of reviews saying there is no story and the world is empty. These people are used to being spoon fed the story and being guided by markers on the map. You have to actually play the game to discover something . Crazy right? The more you play, the more you understand the story because you progress through it. In other games the 6 Minute intro tells you everything you need to know about the story and the rest is just bonus dialogue. There are several endings in this game, giving players even more control over how the story turns out and who you want to be in this **** world. On PS5 I've had no technical issues whatsoever. Not a single crash. The only bug that I discovered was a clipping error which let you see through a wall in Raya Lucaria Academy. I didn't play online or coop that much but I can say that it feels really nice being able to summon other players if you need help. What feels even better is helping other people out when they need help. Multiplayer works great, summoning takes just a few seconds and I never had any connectivity problems. The only thing why I can't give it a 10 is because From Software enabled trolling a little bit too hard. With messages being able to be placed right in front of ladders for example. That way you always accidentally open the message instead of climbing the ladder. If you're in a hurry and want to escape an enemy stuff like that can get you killed. You can however just play offline and none of that will bother you. Also death blight trolls who can team kill you. All-in-all, super polished game with potentially 80-120h of fun. This might not be a game for everyone, yes. But in my opinion the best game to get into the Soulsborn genre. I would recommend it to everyone who wants to have a fresh breeze, a game that truly feels different from all the other triple A games.",9,2022-03-17,PLAYSTATION 5
Keitf,"Absolutely outstanding game. The game has been developed with affection on every detail. Is the map from DS1, joined with the bosses of DS3 in an open world where every inch of the map hides a secret that will blow your mind. 10/10 recommended",10,2022-03-17,PLAYSTATION 5

Kratos_300,"Reseña en español: Para empezar he de decir que el juego es una gran obra, un sobresaliente en esta industria sin duda, pero al igual que cualquier obra, tiene sus cosas buenas y sus cosas malas, por lo que me gustaria comenzar con lo positivo: 1. La direccion artistica es simpemente increible, los diferentes castillos, mansiones, aldeas y demas componenetes del mundo, incluso los propios enemigos y jefes de zona, se sienten unicos y diferentes entre si, todo hecho con una fijacion en el detalle abrumadora, ademas de que dependinedo del punto desde donde se mire, la complejidad del escenario es mejor o un tanto inferior respecto a lo que aparenta, lo que le da un aire de mistisismo al no saber que te encontraras. 2. Las mecanicas, el combate y el gameplay se sienten muy bien a la hora de estar jugando, estan bien planteados cada uno de estos apartados hilado a la clase de personaje que se escoja previamente al inicio del juego, de la mano con la dificultad progresiva del mismo, la jugabilidad es simplemente reconfortante a cada paso que das en la aventura. 3. El diseño de nivel es simpemente perfecto, cosa a la que ya nos tiene acostumbrados su estudio desarrollador con sus anteriores titulos, pero sumandole aun mas cosas gracias a la nueva faseta de mundo abierto. Las posibilidades para completar una zona son casi infinitas, y en ningun momento sientes que algo que no cuadre a tu alredor, todo esta en su sitio por alguna razon, y tu misison es descubrirla. 4. El manejo del mundo abierto bebe mucho de The Legend of Zelda: breath of the wild, osea que todo lo que descubras depende enteramente de tu manera de jugar y tu atencion en la exploracion, lo cual da una sensacion de inmersion enorme, no hay iconos indicandote a donde ir, no hay npcs que te den un numero exagerado de tareas para que te veas en la obligacion de explorar, nada de eso, fromsoftware se esmero en que tu fueras quien forjara tu propio camino. Puntos negativos: 1. Como ya es bien sabido el rendimiento en las diferentes plataformas no es nada optimo, y las consolas tanto de pasada generacion como de la actual son las que en peor estado se encuentran, teniendo un modo rendimiento que oscila entre los 40 y 60 fps, algo no acorde a lo que se espera de un titulo lanzado en estas consolas, junto con esto, su apartado grafico brilla por ser un tanto mediocre, practicamente luce como un juego de hace minimo 5 años. 2. El juego no cuenta con una explicacion por lo menos basica de ciertas misones secundarias, practricanente no te dice nada, por lo que la mayoria de jugadores, creo yo, que se veran obligados a ver algun tipo de guia o ayuda de otros jugadores, lo cual le quita merito a la inmersion, en el caso de no hacer esto, lo mas probable es que te pierdas algun tipo de recompensa o bifurcacion importante de la historia. 2. Hay un numero considerable de enemigos y zonas recicladas entre si, por ejemplo, es muy probable que te encuentres con un jefe secundario mas de una vez, e incluso, una de estas veces puedes encontrartelo como un enemigo comun y corriente, lo cual hace que la lucha contra un enemigo que parezac medianamente importante pierda peso y relevancia, asi como algunas mazmorras son repetitivas e incluso cancinas. 3. No queda muy claro hacia que tipo de jugador va dirigido el juego, lo que si queda claro, es que aunque la libertad de eleccion se ve camuflada por las clases de personaje al principio, al avanzar en la eventura parace que todo te lleva a pensar que es un juego para clases que manejen magia y hechizos, en mi experiencia personal, que jugue con la clase ""Vagabundo"", me ecnontre con mas de un enemigo al que mi armadura, por mas fuerte que fuese, no parecia hacerle frente, esto junto a una barra de vida que parece ser ignorada por los enemigos, te da la sensacion de que estas jugando erroneamente. 4. La interfaz y el HUD son toscos y anticuados para los tiempos que corren, acciones que deberian tomarte como mucho 5 segundos, aqui te toman el triple, tiempo durante el cual, al no existir una pausa, pueden matarte perfectamernte. Elden Ring es un juego maravilloso, pero no es un 10/10, aunque para todo fan de la saga y la dificultad vale completamente la pena.",8,2022-03-16,PLAYSTATION 5

giannis2001,"Great game. The exploring aspect is really fun and th combat smoother than ever (excluding Sekiro). Also, the build variety is huge. What I didn't like that much were the side dungeons (caves,catacombs etc). Some of them are interesting to explore but most of them are boring and become repetitive later on. Another thing I didn't enjoy that much are the bosses. The side bosses become boring fast because you fight them over and over again and in many occasions. Most main bosses are fine but they can't be compared to the ones in Dark Souls 3 by my opinion. Malenia is the only one in the main game that is insanely difficult to defeat and Mogh which offers a great challenge. I think everything else is mid to easy in difficulty. It took me 85 hours to beat the game doing almost everything so it's pretty long. I highly recomend it.",8,2022-03-16,PLAYSTATION 5

Kurisu-sensei,"Yes this is the one of a few games that i give a 10/10 score, I never been a Dark soul or Demon soul fan, not because of the difficulty (I love challenging game and I'm a big fan of Sekiro) but because how slow the movement is, and no jump!!!, it just not my cup of tea. I love Sekiro, challenging, awesome combat system, awesome bosses (so sad that there is no dlc for it) so when Elden ring came, I was really considering should I order it or not, and in the end I gave a try. So? it is awesome, every complaints about Dark soul now is gone in Elden ring, the movement feel so smooth and you can jump (awesome). The world is beautiful, the graphic to be honest not at next level, but it is still beautiful, every lands, dungeons and runes are unique, the combat system is great, still I miss the posture and parry mechanic from Sekiro ( you can still parry if you get the right shield or weapon). Elden ring open world is one of the best period imo, you can explore every placer before the story route, even some of the area at the end game can be even explored very early, so it is also a very forgiving soul like game compare to previous From soft games. It's been a while since I was so into a game like this, spent around 60 hrs already, and this is easily GOTY for me, I downloaded this together with Horizon forbidden west in PS5 and after playing Elden ring, i feel Horizon is a bit boring now even I love Zero dawn (sorry Horizon fan). It has some optimization issue for pc but after some update now it is much better. After playing this game, I'm a big fan of From soft now can't wait for them to release some DLC for it.",10,2022-03-16,PLAYSTATION 5
Kalelos,I love souls games and from software games but in a 2022 game to be so technically bad i didnt expect it. Worst dodge roll input and generally key/button input i have ever experience especially when its always life or death. You have so much fast enemys that can one hit you. You hit button or a combo of buttons not only once and have so much delay that your game does a completly different move or nothing at all. Of course i was expecting better ghraphics and fps in a 2022 game but in a fast pace game which with every mistakes you made you die i didnt expect such a bad input in controlling your character it is simply stupid.,4,2022-03-16,PLAYSTATION 5

sahan47,"as a big soulsborne fan, and finally finishing the game, i think i can give an honest review. first of all, it's a great game. it's a souls like game at it's best. and very approachable for new souls like players. it's fair because it begins difficult which will encourage you to explore the world and as a result, you will get stronger and game gets easier. the map is gorgeous, not only it's not empty, but also not flooded with random useless stuff. everything feels very well balanced. specially the dungeons and creatures which will reward you for with crafting materials and cool items. it's truly a solid game. BUT, allow me to give my humble opinion lol. i don't think it's a masterpiece ****. bugs and graphics has no matter to me. it will get fixed. it's childish to argue about that. art direction is also incredible and i have nothing to argue about. as always, the game stays loyal to it's own rules and i truly respect that. but i think my main problem with this game is, while it's really has a beautiful and artistic world design, it's bad at level design. maybe im biased. i don't know, you judge. i have played everything fromsoftware has offered and i believe they all are masterpieces. and i understand elden ring was a huge project. but it's still not an evolutionary game, in my opinion of course. but the levels are not handcrafted. it doesn't feel the same quality as the quantity is so large. also i feel like for such a large game, there are not enough memorable and bold boss fights, armaments, armor sets and etc. ( i may be so wrong at this part but at least it felt this way at the moment im writing this). in the end i want to say, i am not disappointed. but this game won't be in my heart in a few years, while all soulsborne games are eternally attached to my heart and soul. elden ring is a beautiful game with many lost opportunities. specially for it's multiplayer. think about it. for a game with such a large map. it could have pvp arenas, incredible covenants, hell, there could be a palace for each covenant. areas for getting invaded by certain covenants, etc. again, i totally understand the weight of this project on from software, and i appreciate and respect it none the less. but.. yeah. 96? i don't know.. let's wait and see how the game will be treated after a few months or even a year.",8,2022-03-16,PLAYSTATION 5

lPredator_Godl,"Phenomenal game. I've put over 200 Hours in it and still missed a couple questlines in the first playthrough. The Ashes of War system is great and the Power-Stancing returning is awesome. Can't wait to hop back in with new builds. Only thing I would have liked is a few NG+ changes like Dark Souls 2 had, but I understand it would be harder to implement in a game of this size. You could complain about some bosses being reused but from lore perspective it makes sense. Some bosses that are reused have different status effects and more moves, so it's not like they're all the exact same. Game looks great graphically for a cross-generation game. Of course it's not going to look quite as good as Demon's Souls Remake because that was designed specifically for the PS5 and Demon's Souls is split into separate areas, not one open world. No FPS issues in all of my time playing. Wish people wouldn't review bomb games. **** isn't for you just accept that. Don't go around bashing games simply because they were too hard for you or not what you expected. Do some more research before you buy a game. I preordered because I knew what to expect from From Software after every Soulsborne game before it.",10,2022-03-16,PLAYSTATION 5

ProPaperPusher,"This has to be one of the most overhyped and overrated games of the decade. This game has officially made me think there’s something seriously wrong with gaming journalism and media. I’m dumbfounded by the perfect scores this Game has garner. Games this hard are not fun! A life this hard is not fun. What if every little thing you did in life was literally torture. Well this is Elden Rings. First off the graphics are no where close to Demons Souls Remake on PS5. After playing Horizon Forbidden West on PS5, I’m in pure shock how bad the graphics are in Elden Rings. I was even more taken back by the frame rate. The graphics looks last gen in high resolution if not worst. The frame rate is not as smooth as you would expect especially if you’re used to 60 fps. The difficulty is also one of the biggest big turn offs. I’m sincerely not a fan of games as a torture. Games that make you want to throw your controller are not fun and will never be fun. Games should give you a sense of wonder and awe and Elden Rings fails to do this for me. The open world feels dead compared to Horizon Forbidden West. The world does not feel alive, Elden Rings feels empty and void of substance. Games should be fun, accessible and make you want to come back. Elden Rings feels like a total waste of money.

Then the critic, the second half could drag the rating down to hell. It feels like a change in design direction, in a bad way. The design reminds me of Nioh 1 and Dark Souls 2. Encounters are unfair when everything is hard to kill or stagger and could kill you in two hits ,some level design seems like a death of inspiration with mini-bosses everywhere reused as elite enemies and all the ""weaker"" enemies rather faking death or hiding at the corners.

jorje_mamasitas,"Definetly the worst game from the soul series, as it even gets to be called a ""soul series game"" even though it pretends (or was marketed pretending to) be something new and different. It is not. The game is a poor mixture of Dark Souls 3, Bloodborne and Sekiro. It's absolutely generic, as it copies infinite secondary and mini-bosses from the previous games. The game is an eternal liop in a poor open word, boring and repetitive, with no plot (contrary to what was sold, using the name of George R. R. Martin). After all that, graphics were far better on Demon Souls. Even still, the game struggles to load scenarios, hardly runs smooth on 60 fps using the performance mode and has a lot of issues. For example, I had one boss, wich was so generic I can't remind his name, being sanding still at his final 10% of life waiting for me to put him out of misery (wich was probably being a part of this game). Never seen such an overrated game. I only recomend it if you are in for some dark souls copied gameplay, wich may be fun. Don't expect more than that.",1,2022-03-15,PLAYSTATION 5

Sammyjay94,"I finished the game and platinum it; however, it has many flaws. My first main complaint with the game would be that after visiting an area and getting the item from ruins and dungeons. The game does not gray or give you any indication that you have already visited that area in gotten all of the items that are there. Then you will notice that the sites of Grace which were pointing toward major boss battles. Still point for the exact same boss battle. Making you have to go watch a YouTube video on where to go next. This is outdated game design and should be criticized.. you get very few attack patterns there are only a few weapons that actually give you more than to attack patterns and yes you can add another attack pattern through an ash of War. Sometimes depending on what that Ash of War does. However, the game lacks a lot in combat on your side. Making combat overtime boring. Because you're just doing the same animations over and over and over. My third critique is that multiplayer is actually kind of difficult to figure out especially when the game first launched now I don't understand why it is so Antiquated I guess the programmers thought it would be too hard to program in the fact that you could just sit at a side of Grace and invite friends. But it is extremely difficult to hook up with friends and actually play around together. And explaining it is like explaining an algebra problem. Fourth is there is no Quest log or notes on what NPCs have said. So if you came across it and NPC who was a quest giver and you wanted to try to do the quest yourself and maybe you were trying to remember where to go well good luck you might have to write that down with your own hands. It is there is absolutely no story in this game for a game that has a famous author on the title. There is no story to be found here you might find lore videos on the internet. But it is it entirely up to interpretation and there is hardly any dialogue between any in NPCs in the game. My favorite joke is that you're only going to get five lines of dialogue. With every NPC you come across that's not entirely true but it's a good joke and remind you that you should not expect any story when going into this game in fact the story is entirely up to interpretation and that's not a story because it doesn't have any major at or plot points your character does not grow your character does not change in any major way. Anybody who says any other way is clearly not knowledgeable when it comes to how stories work. The game looks like it should have came out 5 years ago the graphics are lacking. It looks gray and outdated even on a PlayStation 5. It looks like it should have came out alongside Dragon Age Inquisition. If it would have come out around that time it would have been a lot better. However video games have matured the world is boring New Game Plus is very disappointing your first playthrough is going to be extremely fun. And you're going to be excited with the possibilities of what new game plus is but when you get your mine ball bearings took it away from you and you can't buy smithing stones. And you have to discover things that you discovered in the previous play through. For the second time around you're going to find yourself hitting the delete button especially if you want hundred percent it and got the Platinum. This game is overrated and the fans are extremely toxic. I will never buy another from soft game in the future it is a waste of time money and energy the only type of people who are into this type of game series are people who are into being dominated and frankly that is not me.",1,2022-03-15,PLAYSTATION 5

CJ1197,"As an avid FromSoft fan, I must say that this game has not met the hype for me. Many of my fellow SoulsBorne fans are willing to overlook the deficiencies that the game has in its current state, but I am not sure doing so is fair. Like cases should be treated alike, and I wouldn't withhold criticism from another game with performance issues, design flaws, and gameplay weaknesses just because of brand loyalty (or in hopes of future updates and improvements that will more fully capitalize on the potential of the formula), so I will not do so here. My critiques can be boiled down to 2 general points (all approbations of the game left unspoken for the sake of brevity). I am reviewing on PS5. Also, I beat the game after 80+ hours of play. 1. Poor performance and failure to implement next-gen features. I've been playing through RDR2 while playing Elden Ring, and RDR2's graphics are noticeably better than Elden Ring's. I really admire Elden Ring's art direction, and found many in-game vistas quite beautiful, but they should be even more awe inspiring given the capabilities of the PS5. On top of lack luster graphics, the game's performance has been terrible at times. On many occasions, I've had frame rate drops that resulted in the screen, for all intents and purposes, being frozen. On top of that, throughout my entire play through, textures (trees, grass, etc.) wouldn't load in until my character was nearly on top of them. Watching environmental features pop into the screen left and right is really disappointing for a ""next-gen"" game, and is certainly an immersion breaker. My final complaint on this topic is the lack of haptic feedback implementation for PS5. Playing with a lifeless controller, after experiencing the allure of haptics with other PS5 games, is very disappointing (even RDR2 gives me some rumble here and there). 2. The open-world and the FromSoft formula is not a seamless fit. This game took me over 80+ hours to complete, and although I have faced greater boss challenges in other souls games, I was more mentally exhausted playing this game than any other FromSoft title. I don't think Elden Ring alters the From formula enough to achieve ""masterpiece"" status. My 80th hour was not as exciting as my 30th. After that many hours, new and complex areas with concomitant boss challenges become less rewarding and more taxing. By hour 65, I just wanted the game to end. There isn't enough diversity in gameplay to provide enjoyment over such an extended experience. Aesthetic difference between levels didn't make up for that lack of diversity, either. I imagine this complaint would register even more so for new players due to the lack of a strong and compelling narrative. I enjoy the FromSoft approach to narratives, but in a game of this size and scope, players need some sense of story-driven tension woven throughout the experience to keep them engaged. The intermittent narrative tension cobbled around boss encounters hardly suffices. All this to say, I would've enjoyed a smaller and shorter version of this game more than its current version. Its final form just feels bloated. Moreover, I think (emphasis on the tentative nature of this statement) the FromSoft formula works better in the previous iterations than it does here. There was not enough revision of that formula to warrant the immensity of this gaming experience. Challenge becomes chore when the game refuses to end.",7,2022-03-15,PLAYSTATION 5

ClementT98,"Après plus de 100h de jeu et le platine en poche, je pense pouvoir mettre une note à ce jeu. J'ai pris un plaisir monstre à découvrir cet univers construit par George R. R. Martin, je précise bien l'univers car le scénario, les dialogue et les descriptions d'objet sont bel et bien de Miyazaki (FromSoftware). -Un monde gigantesque tant en terme de surface ou de contenu, un jeu qui arrive à entremêler qualité et quantité est assez rare de nos jours et donc à souligner. Je me répète : un univers incroyable, une épopée épique et pleine de mélancolie mêlée au gigantisme du royaume (ref à Shadow of Colossus) -Une exploration intelligente et extrêmement généreuse avec de vrai récompenses à la clé ! -Un gameplay sensiblement identique à celui de Dark Souls 3 mais en plus abouti : des centaines d'armes, sort, miracle, etc... des weapons arts (cendre de guerres) à foison et qui en toute la plupart une vrai utilité lors des affrontements et l'ajout d'un saut mdr, cela peut paraître assez anecdotique mais qui s'intègre parfaitement dans l'exploration et le gameplay roulade/saut -Une réalisation un peu en dessous des standards actuels mais sublimée par la direction artistique du titre, d'ailleurs celle-ci ne faiblit jamais et je tiens à féliciter FromSoftware pour cela !! On peut donc être un peu surpris par les animations un peu rigides et les graphisme ok tiers en début de partie mais une fois la première heure passée, on est dedans et on ne fait plus attention à ça. -Par contre la raison pour laquelle je ne met pas 10/10 est la suivante : Le clipping et l'aliasing sont un peu honteux pour les graphismes proposés en 2022, je ne parlerai pas de l'optimisation PC car j'ai fait le jeu sur PS5 voilà pourquoi j'écris ce test dans la rubrique PS5^^ En conclusion, un chef-d’œuvre vidéo-ludique, le meilleurs jeu de ce début d'année 2022 sans aucun doute et probablement un des jeux les plus épique que j'ai fait de toute ma vie !",9,2022-03-15,PLAYSTATION 5
ThatFinnishDude,"First of all, I HATE souls games... But I LOVE Elden Ring. If you've always wanted to like souls games but just couldn't, this might be for you. I'm now 80 hours in on my first playthrough, stuck on the very last boss. But I'll get him, someday. And in the meantime, there's just so much to do and explore in this beautiful open world filled with secrets. Is it challenging? Yes. Is it unfair? No. Is it rewarding? Very much yes. The game wants you to think with your own head, it doesn't hold your hand like 99% of other games. I'm not gonna lie, you need a commitment to this game.

Bonfera,"I can't rate this game less than 10 just because is from my favorite series of all time. That being said, the game does suffer in some areas like end game balancing.

""Oh my god the world is empty bla bla..."" what do you expect? This is a SOULS game, not a fairy tale with butterflies. People need to understand that From Software always had a unique style, not like the garbage companies that throws unfinished games and even emptier worlds at the costumers at full price. This game IS a must play for the ones who like the series. For the others not so much. From early to mid game it felt balanced, but THE GAME LACKS BALANCE TERRIBLY IN THE LATE GAME, but still i managed to beat it.

TheRealMurad,"I'm a bit ambivalent about how I feel about Elden Ring. A part of me really enjoyed playing this, and playing through a Souls like game again, except in an open world format; however, another part of me thinks this is the worst Souls game ever created. The bosses are cheap, the open world is lacking, and the story feels like there is bound to be a sequel or DLC coming for it. The bosses cheap comes from the fact that the boss' don't really have an AI, it's more so a tracking bot (in the sense of if and else statements), where literally the enemy knows where you are and specifically turns during an animation to smack you. Most of the open world is meaningless. Like there is a lot to do, and see, but most of the items will not fit with your build unless you force it, and even then, it won't help with a boss fight. Finally, the game has balance issues; like severe balance issues. There are multiple bosses where if you grind it out and get runes you can easily murder them, but then there are other bosses who do one-hit ko's no matter what. There are also some bosses who look like leftovers from other Fromsoft games... My highlights for this game was the world building. The game looks great, and has an excellent soundtrack. The art really matches the set-pieces and don't look out of place, and in general, I'm glad GRRM participated in this because you can feel that vibe there. Personally, i think if Fromsoft releases another Elden Ring/ Souls game, I'll be skipping it. I think From doesn't really know what it wants to be anymore, it tries to hard to cater to the generic fans and then the hardcore ones as well, and well, this game is amalgamation of both and a bit too much of it. I enjoyed this game, but it's not really anything innovative, and most times it's more frustrating than fun - so I ask you, do you play games to have fun or be frustrated?",6,2022-03-15,PLAYSTATION 5

DoctorRaccoon,"Nur vorweg: Für eine volle Review von Elden Ring, reichen 5000 Zeichen nicht aus. Daher gehe ich hier nur auf die meiner Meinung nach wichtigsten Punkte ein. Der Großteil des Spiels, also der Teil der nicht aus den Hauptbosskämpfen besteht, gefällt mir sehr gut. Die Erkundung der Spielwelt ist jederzeit ein gefährliches aber lukratives Abenteuer und man findet an jeder ecke irgendwas. Auch den obligatorischen Wasserfall mit der versteckten Höhle kann man finden. Die Landschaften an sich sind sehr schön dargestellt, grafisch kann das Spiel allerdings nicht mit dem Demons Souls Remake mithalten. Es wurde stark auf Partikeleffekte gesetzt, Texturen und Charaktermodelle wurden an manchen Stellen aber ausgelassen. Mein liebstes Beispiel ist hier Patches, da dieser in beiden Spielen vorkommt. Die Kampfmechaniken sind ziemlich genau so, wie in Dark Souls 3, nur dass die Waffenspeziefischen Spezialangriffe nun durch die Kriegsaschen ausgetauscht werden können und man nun Sprungangriffe durchführen kann. Außerdem ist es nun möglich, Geister für die Unterstützung im Kampf zu beschwören. Dabei hat man eine große Auswahl, die allerdings fast immer bestimmten Gegnertypen im Spiel entspricht. Man kann zum Beispiel eine kleine Skelettmiliz, eine Qualle(nicht zu unterschätzen) oder ein 3er Wolfsrudel beschwören, um mal die Anfänglichen zu nennen. Wie auch die geistigen Vorgänger, ist Elden Ring kein leichtes Spiel. Allerdings finde ich es falsch, die Souls Spiele von From Software immer nur als Schwer darzustellen, denn das sind sie nicht unbedingt. Sie sind knackig, ja. Allerdings kann man sich durch das erfarmen von Runen das Leben sehr erleichtern. Die richtige Planung sowie das ein oder andere Waffenupgrade können dabei auch eine Skilllücke schließen, wenn es einem dann doch zu schwer wird. Und in Elden Ring ist das, aufgrund seiner offenen Welt wesentlich einfacher als noch in den Vorgängern. Was mich allerdings sowohl an Elden Ring als auch an den Vorgängern stört, sind die Bosskämpfe. Diese bestehen, anders als in Demons Souls, immer aus dem selben Muster. Man kommt in eine große offensichtliche Bossarena und macht im Prinzip nichts anderes als Rollen, Rollen, Zuschlagen und Rollen. Jeder Boss hat zwar seine eigenen Angriffsmuster, allerdings bleibt dieses Grundprinzip aus Ausweichen spammen und bei Öffnungen zuschlagen immer gleich(bis auf ein Beispiel, auf das ich gleich komme). Die Gegner haben dabei auch Ihre Resistenzen und Schwächen, die Schwächen machen allerdings nicht so viel Unterschied, wie man es sich wünschen würde. Bei Mini- bzw. Nebenbossen sieht das ganze anders aus, denn für diese braucht man teilweise bestimmte Waffentypen oder Angriffsmanöver um das Ruder rumzureißen. Die Bosse sind zwar immer schön in Szene gesetzt, dass aber kaum einer einen nennenswerten Twist hat, ist schade und teilweise sogar nervig. Erfrischend war hier ein Kampf zu Beginn des Spiel, in dem der ""Boss"" von ihren Scherginnen durch einen Schild beschützt wurde und man dem ""Boss"" nur schaden zufügen konnte, wenn man die Schildscherginnen aus der Masse findet und besiegt. Solche Kämpfe würde ich mir häufiger wünschen. Das Problem hierbei war allerdings, dass das nur die erste Phase war und der Boss danach wieder zu einem Rollfest wurde. Allgemein würde ich mir mehr Bosse nach Vorlage von Demons Souls wünschen. Eine Riesenspinne die einen Tunnel versperrt oder einen riesigen Drachen, für den man zuerst die umliegenden Ballisten abfeuern muss um ihn zu besiegen, sucht man hier vergeblich. Das Design und die allgemeine Aufmachung ist zwar immer beeindruckend und imposant, der Kampf an sich ist aber durch das immer gleiche Muster öde. Auch viele Gegnertypen wurden aus der Dark Souls Reihe kurzer Hand Recycelt. Bei Skeletten und Zombies ist das eine Sache, denn die kommen in fast allen Spielen dieser Art vor. Die DS eigenen Schleimklumpen und Frösche allerdings, sind 1:1 übernommen worden, genauso wie die Riesenkrabben. Über die Performance kann ich mich persönlich nicht beschweren. Auf der PS5 merkt man zwar stellenweise die Bildrateneinbrüche, dies wird aber durch den Motion Blur gut kaschiert und ist mir nur selten störend aufgefallen. Allerdings nur im Performance Modus. Im Qualitätsmodus ist die Bildrate merklich ungeeignet für diese Art von Spiel, was aber auch zu erwarten war. Alles in allem bleibt Elden Ring damit aber trotzdem ein gutes Spiel. Auch wenn die Bosse keine Highlights sind(was sie eigentlich sein sollten), weiß die Spielwelt und das Design durchaus zu überzeugen.",8,2022-03-15,PLAYSTATION 5

Northlighforge,"I don’t think the critic reviews are being very honest about this one. I have a lot of mixed feelings about it. On the one hand, it does many things very well. The open world genre really needed something like this to shake things up. On the other hand, this game has some serious issues. If you played any of the previous souls games then I think you’ll like it. I still recommend this title but how it’s being compared to Skyrim or Breath of The Wild or being called “the best game ever made” or “game of the decade” is completely beyond me.",7,2022-03-14,PLAYSTATION 5
Hiddenkaos,"I do wonder how many people would accept the brutal learning curve, the tank controls, and the unintuitive narrative progression system of just explore till you either die or find the next progression; if it wasn't for the fact the series has good lore. I feel like it would be zero, yet people defend its flaws so adamantly you'd think it was Ocarina of Time, when it's not even in the same ballpark. It's a good game, held back from being great simply because it's makers only know how to create difficulty in a game in one way. They finally refined that one way to its best and most polished form, and made a game that is the most playable yet, but its still not able to break free from the design flaws(or niches its fans call them, too unwilling to accept any criticism) that keep it from true greatness.",8,2022-03-14,PLAYSTATION 5

legend999,"One of the most engaging and enthralling experiences I've ever had. I've never been much of a souls player, but I have enjoyed difficult games in the past. I've speedrun a few games in the past too, with Sekiro being my introduction to the series. Coming from relatively difficult games like Cuphead, Sekiro, Hades, and Sifu, Elden Ring did an amazing job making me struggle and feel weak at first, but it does something that games like BOTW could never do for me, which is making me feel like I am getting stronger and progressing. It wasn't just my items and HP that were getting better, it was my entire character. I became so much more skilled than I could re-run all of limgrave with no issues on a new character, but being able to go back to limgrave in the end-game and one-shot some enemies gave me struggles early on was so satisfying. For me, this is a 10, because I haven't been this into and enthralled in a game since my teenage years when I played Skyrim, and it brought me as much enjoyment as I've ever had in a game.",10,2022-03-14,PLAYSTATION 5

aljinn,"Even if Dark Souls / Bloodbourne are 10 (which is not true)... Elden Ring brings us obviously worse UI and UX -1 unoptimized performance -1 same old story (Martin's touch barely exists) -1 and worst of all, worse enemy design -1 or -2 The good part? Gigantic world and better exploration. That makes it 7-8 at best. Where does the 9 and 10 come from? And don't forget most players expect better combat design, but it gets MUCH worse than before with bad and shifting view angles, long-reach multiple combos to render most strategies useless, and deliberate AI that makes every boss fight a time-and-energy-consuming attrition war. In the end, most players rely on only a few specific weapon arts or spells , rinse & repeat. This doesn't feel okay for a combat-centered game, especially not for the well-known Soul-game genre. BTW don't trust those who say no issues with PS5 version. Frame rate is so obviously not stable under performance mode (sometimes the game even stutters a bit), and this potentially affect your dodge precision. Honestly, giving this game ""10"" means either the reviewer is strongly biased toward the Soul franchise, or just got the game for a few hours. Upon further deliberation I decided to lower the score once again, due to the fact that the narrative techniques and riddle design obviously do not go hand-in-hand with its openness and vastness. Many NPCs give no or very ambiguous directions, and very likely appear in places the players have been to; as a result, the ""chore"" or ""fetch boy"" feel is even stronger than other open-world games even when there are only a few ""side-quests"". Riddles like looking for a certain animal never specify a range, combined with the fact that they can climb up the tree, fly in the sky or be invisible. And the instant-death stupid chariot stuff that make players an idiot -- mere trials and errors. All of the above are not challenges to players' intelligence or observation but just tedious tortures. Giving this game a 10 is like encouraging the designers to keep such meaningless and time-wasting tricks.",6,2022-03-14,PLAYSTATION 5

You won't get the most objective opinions. People criticizing the menu's design, lack of story and that the ""addition of a jump button is not big deal"" just shows their ignorance about this genre. To me is a 9. It can be improved. It felt a bit empty at times, and some ""mini"" bosses uninspired. Since i am use to open world and souls games i had no problems with difficulty. I actually didn't get the challenge i was looking for. Beautiful level-design specially inside castles. But we already know what Miyazaki can do. It was an improvement in everything i knew about Souls games. I hope peoples emotional reactions don't undermine the beautiful work done here. It shows there was a lot of heart put into it. And that's all we can ask for. Be grateful.",9,2022-03-14,PLAYSTATION 5
Renzokuken,"As a disclaimer, I'm not one of the ""souls games should have an easy mode"" crowd, and I've cleared every soulsborne title to date. Elden Ring offers one of the most expansive, most carefully crafted and painstakingly curated open world experiences ever created. The game, it's environments, it's enemies, lore and set pieces are all stellar, there's so much to do, explore and conquer here assuming you're up to the game's considerable challenge. The only reason this isn't a straight 10/10 experience, is I feel FromSoft, in search of ensuring the difficult experience translates over to an open world game, have sacrificed fairness in some aspects of the game and have also left in some of the jankier aspects of souls combat that really should have been addressed by now. Firstly, melee is grossly out shined by magic and status effects, the balance here is very poor for a game that focuses so much on melee combat. Input delay is fairly prominent and makes the experience feel a little less fluid than previous games. Hitboxes vary between ultra precise and horrendous depending on the enemy. Jank within it's combat systems remains, for example I can knock an enemy down, and it's completely untouchable until it stands up, meanwhile enemies can wail on me if they knock me down. There are several instances of twin boss encounters that just use two of a normal boss you already fought, many of these aren't balanced for a duo encounter. There are some bosses that forgo the tight reaction based combat of previous entries and rely on what can only be described as random, uncounterable flailing around and/or AOE spam, thankfully these aren't present in great numbers. Player experience would be greatly enhanced if the map gave a recommended level range for its zones. Unlike previous more linear entries, I can see people calling the game out as impossible, when they just wandered into a high level zone accidentally as many of the high level areas are directly next to low level ones with nothing restricting access. Balance at higher levels is also off, many attacks are a one or two shot kill at the vigor softcap, meaning even if you stack HP your survivability is still exceptionally poor, this once again favours magic over melee. Anyway, I know that's a lot of negatives, this is still a fantastic souls game, but it's also the one I've had to put down in frustration the most. With new territory comes new BS to iron out, hopefully by Elden Ring 2 we'll have better balance, but don't let that put you off trying this.",8,2022-03-14,PLAYSTATION 5

Brownthunder89,If you like breath of the wild?Then this is for you. First of I'm no dark souls fan . I've only played bloodbourne and not the other games. Games like this are so rare now days.. Games that don't hold your hand . Games that just expect you to simply become a better player. Now this formula only works for some people. It has a steep learning curve and it's hard when you start out.. and i personally love games that are hard only for you to become a god later on. No this game does not have the best graphics. But the view and the layouts are amazing to look at.. i mean the world looks amazing. There's stuff everywhere. Hidden things all over the place. If you see it it usually means you can go there. Reminds me alot of dragon's dogma but with even better boss design. It's a tough game. I've put 100 hours into it already. Probably got another 50 to go. If you don't like frustratingly hard games then this one is simply not for you. Stop review bombing the game based on difficulty.

Many dungeons are reminiscent of Chalice Dungeons in Bloodborne, except they have less enemy variety and are shorter.

Spleenicus,"Elden Ring is the simultaneous revitalization of the Soulsbourne genre and a masterclass achievement of game design. From Software have not only polished and refined their tried-and-true combat system, but breathed life into its gameplay via the greatest open world I have yet to play. The open world is neither the sole focus of the game nor a tacked-on gimmick: its a tool by which the excellent gameplay can be experienced. At any point, you can choose to delve into the excellently designed dungeons of the Lands Between, or, if they prove too difficult for you just yet, venture into the bountiful yet still dangerous world to level up and unravel the world's mysteries. This is not an ""Easy Mode"" to just cheat away the difficulty of the dungeons with a Level 100 character: it is an option to alleviate and replace the difficulty of reflex driven combat with the critical thinking and adventure that well-designed open-worlds demand. Pardon the overused phrase, but in this way Elden Ring truly, has........a little something for everyone. (I'm sorry)",10,2022-03-14,PLAYSTATION 5

Souls games are way more than challenging, they are brutal and even with best gear you can die easily and for most people, this is not fun. Just speaking facts.",1,2022-03-13,PLAYSTATION 5

OtherwiseSix,"DISCLAIMER: At the time of writing this review, the S.E.A. copies of the game for console are still locked to a single language, predominantly Chinese. As a Canadian living in Japan, my copy is locked to Japanese, which is greatly reducing my potential enjoyment of the game. That said, my minor Japanese knowledge and experience with previous Souls titles has allowed me to play regardless. I'm holding onto hope that the Elden Ring team or Bandai Namco Games will be able to add a patch or a DLC Language pack, but until that time I CANNOT recommend this game for any foreign residents living in Asia unless you are familiar with Chinese (or Japanese in Japan). I was worried going into this game that the open world would detract from the thing I love most about Dark Souls: The intricately crafted level design and meticulously planned out world/player experience. In some aspects, it does, but I think the open world adds a lot more to the game than it detracts. The intricate level design and the experiences are still there in spades for the players, but with the added benefit of ramping up the exploration aspects to 11. I also think it improves the accessibility of the franchise. If a boss/area is too difficult, there are dozens of other bosses and areas to go take on or explore. In previous series, you would have a few options, but if none of them were viable to you then you either wasted time grinding or quit. Just by exploring more of the rich and fantastical world that Miyazaki and George R.R. Martin have brought to life, players can get stronger while discovering secrets, powerful abilities and unique equipment. There are also a lot of new abilities and quality of life improvements added to Elden Ring such as summon spirits and ashes of war. It's virtually a guarantee that any player will be able to conquer any of the challenges that Elden Ring sets before them with enough ingenuity, planning and exploration. I would highly recommend this game to any fans of previous ""Souls/Borne"" titles, people who like exploration, people who enjoy challenging gameplay, and fans of open world games (who don't mind a larger-than-typical challenge of other open world games as there is no quest log and few map markers to speak of).",9,2022-03-13,PLAYSTATION 5

The story is pretty much not there, and I don’t think that a games story being “cryptic” is a good thing. The gameplay is fine enough, but it doesn’t really feel like anything that hasn’t been done before. The graphics are honestly really nice and not nearly as bad as people say. Of course the world is absolutely beautiful, as is the music. The game is hard but I wasn’t expecting it not to be. It just isn’t my preferred kind of “hard” in a video game. Overall this is a game that can really only truly be enjoyed to its fullest by hardcore souls fans, which I am not. I’m sure it’s an awesome game, that just isn’t for me.

Esse jogo evolui o mundo aberto em diversos aspectos, o jogo traz inúmeros inimigos e chefes que me fez perder a conta, a evolução do personagem mesmo que de forma lenta é gratificante . O set e as composições de build são inúmeras . Esse jogo claramente tirou a sensação de “ massivo “ que muitos jogos vem trazendo, essa sensação de cansaço e monotonia não está presente em Elder ring .

Next_Gen,"If we look at broad range of video games, for example 1990 till 2022, Elden Ring achieves absolutely nothing new. One could only call it revolutionary if 1, you only play Souls games 2. Haven't played open world games before 3. You are blindfolded fanboy, who defends this game no matter what. These kinds of unique/cool looking huge bosses were already in Resident Evil 4 and were done better. Let me remind you, this was 2005. Dead Space did similar thing with bosses, this was 2008. But what these games also had was story, depth, meaningful characters - Elden Ring has hardly any of that. Sure they were not open world, but in Elden Ring people clearly don't care about that ""open world"" anyway, they just run from one boss to another, that's the whole game. So in my opinion this comparison is fair. If we talk about open world games that have lots of huge monsters/bosses then Skyrim is amazing example for that, but that was 2011. And that game also had quest log, story and up to date graphics. So let me ask again, what is exactly so revolutionary and new in Elden Ring? What is this phenomenal new thing that this game supposedly archives? There's none of that. Taking away quest log, so you wont remember half the quests you did, is revolutionary? It's truly, truly sad to see that some people are actually trying to hype this game up and pretend like it's greatest thing ever, while very clearly these people have never even heard of games i just mentioned. I mean, if you love this game, good for you, play it forever i guess. All i wish for is just that there would be also normal games left for gamers who actually like to have fun and not die for one boss 200 times, just so you could figure out their move set, beat them and then move to next boss and repeat same thing 1000 times.

This game achieves SO much on so many fronts, and the love and care that went into making the game is SO apparent from the moment you step out into Elden Rings’ expansive, giant, monumental, unfathomable world. Yes, this may not be your type of game, but that doesn't mean it is a bad game or that you should rate it low. I believe this game is a monumental achievement in gaming and ON TOP OF THAT I enjoy every single little thing about it. Put both those things together and you have a 10/10 game from me.

Fricka,"I initially made a review for this game that was a perfect 10/10 score. At this point, I had not yet finished the game. The first half of Elden Ring is without a doubt one of if not the greatest open world game ever crafted. However, once you reach the wintery areas and the second half of the game begins, there is a noticeable fall in quality. Areas are now barren and empty and there are little to no new bosses in sight. The biggest issue however with the second half is its balancing, in which the game no longer feels fair and instead is hard for the sake of being hard. Enemies now do too much damage and you do too little, but the most egregious thing is the way the bosses in the second half work. These bosses are lightning fast and are brewed together with **** mechanics and constant AOE that at times feels unavoidable. The fact that bosses can transition so quickly into a new combo without you having time to react makes the game sided against anyone who isn't using a dex or magic build, meaning that players no longer have the freedom to choose however way they want to play and now have to abide by meta builds in order for bosses to seem feasible. The first half alone would be a 11/10, but the abhorrent second half (although it does have its moments) brings it down for a 9 for me, still an excellent game, but one that disappoints.",9,2022-03-13,PLAYSTATION 5

arcvox,"Elden Ring is the fruition of esoteric mystique in lore and visual storytelling and challenging gameplay in a dark fantasy setting. The challenge this time around was implementing an open world and not falling into the trap that so many others fall into; being wide as an ocean but as deep as a puddle. From has managed to create a landscape so full of content, secrets and genuinely rewarding exploration that it is at times quite overwhelming to completionist players. What makes this game extra special is that it doesn't lose its identity in branching out to a new approach either- the game stays true to the Souls' original beloved formulae while also daring to go in new directions. During my time with the game there have been so many incredible moments, some even going as far as reminding me of childhood memories, living out my imagination as to what the perfect adventure game could be. It's hard to put into words, but it really is amazing that they were able to fit in as much as they have into a 50gb game. There are rabbit holes everywhere which twist and turn into new landscapes, some of which are hidden within already hidden areas. 50 hours in and I'm still discovering new places to explore.

mithril_dm,"After days and days of seeing this game praised to the end of the earth and back I picked up a copy to try my hand. I strongly recommend waiting several months for some updates to make this game playable. I will revisit this review when the game's technical mess is fixed on PS5 or PC. Pros - The bosses are very cool and quiet unique, and very fun to fight (when the fps isn't falling through the floor) - The world is very beautiful despite the old engine - The variety of classes, weapons, and items to pick up is great and fun to play around with - The open world is great to explore and very enjoyable, feels very fun to feel like I'm discovering secrets Cons - From a technical perspective this game is a mess. The frame rate is abysmal, even in performance mode but especially in quality mode. I couldn't play more than 20 minutes without getting motion sick, and had to stop several times because of this - Frame rate is about 40-55fps, never stable, and was occasionally dropping to less than 20. - The game is intentionally hostile to anyone who hasn't played the previous games and is very inaccessible, and has no interest in engaging new players to its obtuse systems - The UI is actively terrible. Finding items, figuring out how to upgrade items, figuring out what to do with runes, even closing the map, are all made intentionally obtuse for seemingly no reason. A simple example; the button to open the menu and to close the menu are two different buttons for no good reason, completely wasting the limited buttons available on a controller. Every button was very unintuitive to me This is a game made only for fans, and even though I think there's a lot to be enjoyed, feeling like the developers are constantly trying to hamstring me in stupid (and not game play related) ways and sell me a product that is extremely unoptimized is not my idea of fun.",6,2022-03-13,PLAYSTATION 5

Jesus Christ. Obviously lots of people were baited into buying this game, because ""apparently now everyone can play it"", who cares that 80% can't even beat first boss, am i right? Just cause it sold over million copies means absolutely nothing. 80% will never beat the first boss, 90% will never complete the whole game or even half of it. This is not what mainstream means. GTA 5 is mainstream, because people keep playing. 80% who bought Elden Ring will figure out that it's not for them and quit. And then of course in same video they need to bash Ubisoft games as much as possible, they just can't help themselves lmao. Arguments like ""all Ubisoft games are same"" are especially hilarious now when Elden Ring is literally copy pasting other souls games, in open world setting. By the way let's get this idiotic thing out of the way, no, all Ubisoft games are not the same, as much as you want it to be true, it's simply not true. Assassin's Creed, Watch Dogs and Ghost Recon Wildlands are not same games as much as Ubisoft hater would like them to be. Simply not true. They might share some similar elements, but overall they are all completely their own thing. But in other hand, Elden Ring is literally re-using animations from 2016 video game. I have nothing against Youtubers giving their opinion about video games and whatever else. It's great. Just kind of **** that lots of them have absolute trash taste in gaming, but it is what it is i guess. By the way that trash taste would be also complete fine, if they wouldn't be so butthurt over Ubisoft, that they need to sht on that company every moment possible.

Kukhtia,"You will love this game if you are a huge fan of the From Software games (FS further on). Like, real fan. That’s it. And if you are a fan, you don’t care about reviews. Otherwise you most probably will hate it, especially if you buy it because of all the hype around it or if the only game you played from FS was Dark Souls Remastered. Forget it, DS Remastered is a masterpiece in comparison with Elder Ring. You will hate it for no clear in game story (well that’s usual for FS), underwhelming complexity with no reward, very average graphics (well it not bad for FS games, but not in comparison with other) and open world which actually doesn’t make any sense in that game. As world’s lore is maniacally “foggy”, twisted and complicated and world itself provides you with veeeery few tips and hints about what happening, there is no desire or fun to investigate it at all. It mostly consists of empty areas and deadly mobs which you will grind day by day to make a next level up, so you can do same in next area. Also, most importantly, game is lagging on PS5 even in performance mode! Graphics mode is unplayable at all, as fps drops to a slide show, maybe that will be tuned a little by patches, but for the game where half second delay is critical this is totally unacceptable.

This game is being review bombed by users on here due to the difficulty and to them I just have to say, watch gameplay **** before you spend $60 on it.

Jansen89,"Well. It feels so clunky in comparison to sekiro. And I really don't understand the 97 Metascore and the 10/10 User hype. Why is this the best game ever? The open world is kinda empty and dull, the story is meh (if you like to piece it together and read), performance **** on ps5, combat feels clunky as already mentioned, graphics are outdated and so on.... Sure, It's from software and it's own genre yeah sure, but for me this is just a letdown and surely doesn't live up to the hype. Honestly this is not an innovative masterpiece. In no aspect. Fun and challenging but just recycled fromsoft stuff. And definitely not for the average gamer. EDIT: The design of Quests is absolute garbage. I bet 99% of players need to play with fextra life / guides to even get them or find them. The story is literally non existant. That's just horrendous design in such a huge game. Gets boring quick.. I wish it had a story and good quest design.... Sad.",5,2022-03-12,PLAYSTATION 5

RPG’s to be specific, this is the single worst most frustrating game I’ve ever played. There are no words to explain how not fun this is. 46 hours later and I still don’t know what to do next, where to go next, how to get to the vast majority of the map. This is a 3 hour game that pretends to be 100’s of hours by not telling you ANYTHING. Just wander around and guess until you find a boss that you can’t beat. There should be laws against this kind of trash. Or at a bare minimum a refund policy for misleading us.",0,2022-03-12,PLAYSTATION 5
dharma,"Many AAA games bored me, with their same third party mechanics and high production values. They are basically the same games but with a high budgeted veneer. Enter Elden Ring, Fromsoft's masterpiece will kick your a@# so hard like their previous games, but creates a world so vast and so dangerous that you will be addicted to explore every nook and cranny. If Zelda is Miyamoto's dream then Elden Ring is its polar opposite, a nightmare that you will not want to wake up from, until you mastered and conquered it, probably hundreds of hours later.",10,2022-03-12,PLAYSTATION 5
baws,"Awesome Game. 179.5 hours invested. intense cutscenes and story lines if you will to put in time. This game isnt fully optimized, but also most of peoples pc's are **** doodling around with an old ryzen 5 or intel are wondering why a CPU heavy game isnt running well, while their cpu is at 85-90°C. I had small frame drops in certain areas which are re-createable, cause it was bound to loading of the next big patch of an area. but that was minimized in a patch a few patches later. I never lagged in an Bossfight. My only complain is, the reuse of some Dungeon Bosses, just giving them more HP and more Damage, which is simply just boring when you learned the boss already. Haters gonna hate and vote it down cause people love the game and the genre. Its a Fromsoft game with 5X the current playerbase than dark souls3. from 214k(ds3) or some to a million(ER). And with hype the casuals and hater come in and talk it bad. while millions of people enjoy the game, they come here to hate and feel better with their problems aka getting **** by the game. laughable",9,2022-03-12,PLAYSTATION 5

Enigma-sensei,"The review is at the bottom. Hope it helps. A lot of this is just a biased rant more than than anything, considering I've 100%'d the prior games that FromSoft have released. I've played the game for 200~ish and I'm level 167. The biggest problem with the game is that its hyped up, got a 95-97 score(one of the highest rated games of all time), a large amount of players new to the Souls-like genre grab it without knowing anything about it, and how FromSoft makes their games. And they think they can rush through it like they do with their Ubisoft/EA games. Those types of players are just not experiencing the game in the glory they were supposed to. There's a public perception with Elden Ring, the 10/10s and “must plays"" being tied to a niche and easy game, being wrapped in mega ultra hype from companies and fans alike. The 4 biggest gripes I've seen about the game is that: 1. The game looks worse than previous generation(s) titles, which, is just not right. Of course the game doesn't look as good as, say Forza, Tarkov, Flight Sim, just to name a few, but the game does not look terrible in any means whatsoever. There's a massive difference between ER and DS3 in graphic output, and it's around the same level as AC Valhalla, if not actually looking better. And in my personal opinion it looks comparable to Demon's Souls remake, of course the remake looks better, but most the spells look to be in the same ballpark. 2. Performance issues, the game has MAJOR performance issues for all parties, for me, who's only played on Xbox and PS5, I've had no issues so far, no frame drops, and no tears or anything, so I'm lucky I suppose. Only really seen two bugs and that's with the horseback gameplay. 3. Reused animations, the animations thing makes me wonder if people have even played the game, and any game for that matter. OF COURSE the games going to have reused animations, because they work. It’s going to produce the same end result. These type of people don’t understand that doing stuff from scratch takes time and testing time. Every studio will reuse assets if possible, some examples are Majora's Mask, which reused quite literally almost all off the animations from OOT, and Fallout: NV, which reused a metric ton of the assets from prior games in the series, and many more game series do this same exact thing. They've literally added 3-5 new attack chains for EVERY weapon type, and new and unique weapon arts, and interchangeable ones. Even if they reused all assets from DS3, the new ones they added would outnumber them several times over. 4. No story, this one just isn't thrown into your face. The game does have story, just gotta look for it. But it is rather difficult to actually find it so I understand the complaints. And especially the fact that George RR Martin was tuned in with the story, seems a bit lackluster. Now myself included of course has some gripes. Such as the games dungeon system being massively rehashed, almost all Catacombs are the same, Hero Graves and repeating minibosses and etc. Just rehashed areas with only a few unique ones. But that's outweighed from how massive the game is and the amount of content there is. The main areas in the game such as Limgrave, Liurnia of The Lakes, Leyndell are all really well made areas. Gameplay: 10/10, same souls type game I fell in love with many years ago. Exploration: 9/10, one of the few open world games I've played that doesn't feel extremely empty to me. I really enjoy it. Only bad thing is as i said above, the dungeon problem. Story: 8.5/10, I enjoy the story, it's not as cryptic as the other souls games, easier to follow and it pretty good for what I've experienced. Accessibility/Performance: For me, a 10/10, but as I've read for hundreds of others, that seems to be a 1/10. But for me, a 10. Art Direction: 10/10, Don't got much to say, just good. Graphics: 8.5/10, for me anyways, since a lot of people say the game looks absolutely horrid, the game is beautiful. Difficulty: 9/10, I'm by no means bad at the game, but the game in some places just truly seem like a gimmick. Some enemies are rather hectic and are overall just cringe to fight. But it’s still not overwhelmingly difficult, it has a decent learning curve for people completely new to the genre, and it also doesn't hold back for returning soul veterans. Music: 6/10. I just dislike the music for this game. Doesn't stroke the flame like Sekiro and DS1-3 did to me. My final score would be a 8~9/10 game, but for the sole fact i am enjoying this game, i’m giving it a 10/10. Games great, if you get past some of the inherent difficulty that a souls-like is going to have, the game is amazing and i truly recommend it.",10,2022-03-12,PLAYSTATION 5
lazerdragon,"I wish Fromsoft would learn from Ubisoft and Rockstar how to make fun and entertaining games, sadly Elden Ring is another example of how boring Fromsoft games really are. I was exploring 5 hours and i have never felt so empty inside while playing a video game. Souls combat is also awful, i guess some people like predictable combat, but i like chaotic combat. I don't want to learn some move sets, so i could beat this random boss. Souls combat is like chess, you only have certain moves that you have to repeat over and over, that's the whole combat. Assassin's Creed and Witcher combat is way better, you have so much more freedom to choose how, where, when you attack, etc. Very disappointed in Elden Ring, i'm not saying they have to change anything, because clearly some people like this kind of gameplay, but i have feeling that it's more like minority. Strong doubt that most gamers would prefer Souls combat over Witcher combat.",0,2022-03-12,PLAYSTATION 5

UltimaOG,"If you like exploring alien worlds and landscapes, even if the entire population and bestiary is hostile to you ON SIGHT, and you don't need a compelling reason to do any of it, because you are fine with making it up on your own, or just love a challenge for the sake of a challenge, or you believe that killing things and taking their stuff is its own reward... then this game is truly is a 10 out of 10. On top of that, this game is BEAUTIFUL. The enemy design is breathtaking. You will find joy in discovering the 100's of varied enemy creatures that dot the landscape. There is so much to find - and kill - in this game. However, the game is an endless repetition of set piece battles, that reset immediately when you get to a check point and pause the game. This reset breaks the immersion of the world, and reminds you that this is just a game, and these characters are just automatons, going through the motions, like some kind of fun house. There are TONS of hidden weapons, armors, and enemies, just waiting for you to find them. But the game only provides a backstory for the Bosses and NPC's. It doesn't actually give you a detailed or compelling reason as to why you're killing them all. Did they do something to you? Destroy your people? Who ARE your people? You can't be from this land, because NOBODY apparently lives here except the monster automatons. That is why this game is a solid 7. It gives you LOTS and LOTS of things to discover and kill. It's a visual masterpiece. But the game controls are difficult, your character animations are woefully slow compared to your enemies, the game's economy/xp system was designed for the grinders, and the game provides ZERO context or a compelling narrative in which you can take part. SOLID 7/10.",7,2022-03-12,PLAYSTATION 5
ZXSth,"For anyone wondering about whether or not they might enjoy Elden Ring, I believe that it is important to say that Elden Ring is only slightly more accessible than most of its Dark Souls predecessors. This is still very much a challenging video game that prioritizes strategic, skill-paced combat, and does not hold your hand. It is centred around traversing a fantasy world full of grim and grotesque enemies, and its story is mostly told in vague snippets of lore. These offerings are not meant as criticisms - they are simply statements about what one who has never played a FromSoft Dark Souls-style game might expect from this game. For my part, I can comfortably say that this is one of the most deeply engrossing, comfortably challenging and overall awe-inspiring video game experiences I've ever had the pleasure of playing. Some areas of the game definitely possess that old-school, claustrophobic feel of the Dark Souls games, and bring back those narrow corridors with enemy distributions that feel sadistic - however, there are also numerous wide-open spaces filled with breathtaking views, where you can also accidentally run right into an extremely intimidating boss that could easily overwhelm you. Can I recommend this game to everyone? Absolutely not - it's a Souls game, through and through. It is not the colourful, easily accessible romp through a colourful, hooking world that games like Minecraft, Fortnite or Mario might offer. But this is a game that, even after the 150+ hours I have clocked playing it, still provides excitement, a sense of discovery, and an astonishing amount of opportunities to experiment when it comes to fighting enemies. Elden Ring is somewhat obtuse, challenging (sometimes shockingly so) and will not hold your hand. However, it is also an undeniably incredible video game that could easily provide you with well over 1000 hours of enjoyment. This is a no-brainer for anyone who ever enjoyed a Souls game, but also offers new players a chance (the most of any game of its kind, but still not much of one) to experience their first Souls game. Elden Ring might not be for everyone, but anyone who ends up enjoying it is almost certainly going to absolutely love it.",9,2022-03-12,PLAYSTATION 5

Best decision I've made in quite some time - I was very much looking at putting down video games for a more casual experience potentially looking at chilling out with borderline basic games like The Last of Us. The best way of describing it was complete gaming fatigue, too many games are filled with overbearing HUDs, hand-holding and damn micro-transactions. The practices of the industry are shameful and honestly make me want to quit playing games altogether. That being said. If there's an 'Elden Ring' of games every couple of years.

It's ridiculous how every fight past liurnia is a constant slog and I must die repeatedly to learn fights or mobs. That's not good game design. Even Sekiro was not like this untill Genichiro. This is beyond pathetic. This is game Developers just being **** IMO. No need to make a brutal AI that predicts your patterns. That's just being mean and not fun. I am tired of trash mobs slaughtering me despite being near lvl 100, and tired of dying 500 times to a boss because there are no clear patterns other than 1 or two moves to visually see beforehand. I don't get why people like this company, and game. They have not evolved anything other than the world, which I admit is gorgeous.

Saigon55,Eldin is a great game & a must own. I have 80hr into the game & haven't even opened up the entire map yet this just might be the biggest game ever made no joke.,9,2022-03-11,PLAYSTATION 5
AshB86,Praise the Sun. Been waiting on this game for years. It didn't disappoint. From Software has made a classic that will change how open world's will be built for years to come. It's the most assessable From Software game but nowhere near easy. Masterpiece,10,2022-03-11,PLAYSTATION 5
HellOfaHunter,Repeated bosses in the exploration part. Same way in telling story as ds. Hard to complete side quest due to no pointer will show u the related NPC will be at in that huge empty world. Bad graphics and performance but good visual art.,4,2022-03-11,PLAYSTATION 5

MxCarnage,"After 80 hours of play I’m downgrading my score from 6 to 4. This game is a prime example of over-hyped. It’s fun but certainly not a 10 nor is it a 0. It adds nothing new to gaming that hasn’t been done elsewhere and typically done (much) better. Movement and combat certainly have improved compared to previous iterations of this game. The overall accessibility is still bad, be it by design or incompetence. For example, the inventory is so clunky and dated. Key information on items stats is hidden, for a “core” game this should be easily accessible. Most of the game’s difficulty comes from obfuscation of the game’s mechanics, so you have to resort to online guides & walkthroughs. The current v2 of this game is riddled with bugs making it very easy ridiculously easy. Most encounters can be completely bypassed and “legendary” loot (broken, overpowered) can just be grabbed without effort. For a game who’s USP is to “be hard” this makes it a complete joke. Nevertheless, I do have a lot of fun exploring and fighting but there remains a constant feeling this game could have been so much better. Hopefully patches will make it better.",4,2022-03-11,PLAYSTATION 5

Baldalor,"If this isn’t a masterpiece ****, I don’t know what is. This is Dark Souls, but with an open world setting. But the essence of crawling through dungeons reminiscing the challenging areas that are hallmarks of the series is still there. The exploration adds a whole new aspect to the game that I never knew I needed in a souls game, but I gladly appreciate now. All in all, the combat is good as always, if not better with a plethora of options on how you can build the way you like to play. Give this game a chance, it might not be for everybody, but this one sure is more welcoming than the previous ones.",10,2022-03-11,PLAYSTATION 5
sametto,I see so much negative review ıdk why. This game so so so good blow my mind every time every map every boss its so so good. I feel the world. U can feel the fear inside. U can feel the wtf this is so hard to kill this boss. If u can do great build u can kill every one. I see meele **** no u **** u cant play this game meele is realy good if u using blood shot and good ashes of war. And this game have so much ashes of war. U can play magican or warior. Yes this game HARD but ı love it.,10,2022-03-11,PLAYSTATION 5

I cant remember a game that make me so satisfied to play since Baldurs Gate 2, Skyrim, The Witcher 2 and 3, Doom, Duke Nuken, Age of empires, Golden Axe, Diablo 2 or Streets of Rage. This game is an instant classic and a must play, without a doubt.",10,2022-03-11,PLAYSTATION 5
llSBuNNYll,"One of the best games I have ever played. I'm 70 hours in and I cant recommend it enough. Sure, the first couple of hours was a bit slow, since you dont really know where you should go, but soon you understand where to gi and what to do. The difficulty is hard, but not brutally hard, most of the game is easier than DS and Sekiro. If you dont like DS you wont like this game, but if you love DS you Will have an absolute blast playing this game! The map is huge, theres so many different enemies, caves, bosses and so on. Doesnt matter which way you travel, you Will find something interesting there! If 11/10 was an option, this game would have earned it. Game of the Year without a doubt. Edit: I have played over 300 hours and completed the game 3 times. And it Just keeps on getting better and better! Btw my ""game of the year guaranteed"" statement aged well dont you think?",10,2022-03-11,PLAYSTATION 5
Angra78,"I know 20 hours is not that much game time considering the biggest soulslike game to date, but even so I was able to explore, and die a lot. I started with the Samurai Class thinking I could be like the Starving wolf from Sekiro, but man i was wrong... I had my ass whooped, but the problem was not the game it was my mind set. I got frustrated and decided to start all over as Vagabond and changed the play style to the one I used back in 2009 with my soldier class in Demon's Souls, ho boy, what a difference, I rearranged my equip and my weapons to a melee play style based on strength and I was able to smooth the things up. So if you are struggling, don't be ashamed in starting over with a new class, Elden ring brought to Soulslike genre all we needed in past games, it's less punishing but that doesn't mean it's easier, some enemies and bosses are quite challenging but very satisfying when once overcame. I haven't had any performance issues or bugs so far, only some render delays but nothing much. Overall it's a great game, maybe a new starting point for the Soulslike genre, a sample of what Fromsoftware can provide from now on, and this is something interesting about them they know how to balance between new and old ideas. This is the passion we need from more devs. For newcomers keeping up, it might be a game that suits you, if it still doesn't, well let it go!",10,2022-03-11,PLAYSTATION 5

It still has a Dark Souls challenge to it, but they provide you with a map, and the tools you need to succeed. With it being open world, if you are struggling, just go somewhere else until your stronger. Lots of weapons and armor, spells, and awesome enemies. This game is a for sure 10/10 for me. Finally a game that seemed finished on release, rather than waiting for updates to make it fun.",10,2022-03-11,PLAYSTATION 5

Balzari,Visuals: 9 - Audio: 8 - Fun: 9 - Longevity: N/A - Engagement: 9 - Overall Score: 9 (so far) Only started playing 'Elden Ring' so I can only offer a 'Work in progress' review 'Elden Ring' is better looking than 'Dark Souls 3' but not as polished as the 'Demon's Souls' remake. Music is typically rousing when combat takes place and calm / relaxing when roaming the world. Controls are almost identical to previous 'Dark Souls' games but with a few new moves that really enhance gameplay. 'Elden Ring' is a 'Souls' game that has been inspired by 'Zelda: Breath of the Wild' which is an absolutely brilliant thing. So far 'Elden Ring' feels more of an evolution rather than a revolution however I am really enjoying it and can totally recommend.,9,2022-03-11,PLAYSTATION 5

Konradoraptor,"Elden RIng has proven to be to be an excellent game, in my eyes easily capable of winning game of the year. Firstly the open world is absolutely stunning, it is a lovely place to look at. Secondly I for one really enjoy the combat as it is relatively easy to pick up with the basics of hit and dodge, but there is so much depth to be discovered. So please do not pass this up as it is truly fantastic",10,2022-03-10,PLAYSTATION 5
Harmorra,"Like any good game should be, Elden Ring isn’t for everyone. It follows FromSoft’s gameplay, design choices and philosophy. It’s about exploration and wandering. It urges, no almost forces you to do so. The game is hard, unforgivable but rewarding. Questlines are plenty, but the story and the lore isn’t presented with handholding. You have to think. Think a casual first playthrough will between 70-100 hours. And then you’ll miss half of the game, maybe even more. Together with the abundance of builds and ways to play, this game will stick around for sometimes. Like I said the game is not for everyone. If you want newgen crispy graphics, Storymode or a fast 1 hour game between chores, this is not for you. It certainly has it’s quirks and technical difficulties, but for me all is forgiven. It’s an open world Dark Souls, and I love it!",5,2022-03-10,PLAYSTATION 5

JonnyMenthol,"Absolutely fantastic and one of the best games ever, definetly the best Souls game but perhaps not the best Soulsbourne game, I'll have to replay Bloosbourne and Sekiro after this to evaluate that. I've been playing it fairly slow compared to others, it seems at 60 hours +7 on launch night before I re rolled my build. I want to savour it and I hope it never ends and by the looks of the full map that people keep spoiling on social media I'm less than half way through the game and even now I feel it is gigantic It never feels empty and every discovery is am organic, rewarding moment. It's still Souls combat with a tad more fluidity and the graphics aren't Sony level but in HDR it looks as pretty as Ghost of Tsushima at times. ....Agh, people on here have said it a million times. This game is the rare 10/10 that could be scored 11/10 and it'd still make sense. I know it's a game I'll play annually or every few year, for many years to come.",10,2022-03-10,PLAYSTATION 5
Maxie1077,"This Game is as close to perfection as video games can come. I've seen so many people get to the first or second main story boss and just give up. These people go on to leave a 5 or less review on this website. Please at least complete 80% of the game before crying and calling the game bad because you couldn't beat a boss. Don't get me wrong, this game will piss you off. Ruthless bosses and enemies being the main contributers to this factor. But they are all set up in a way that makes it fair, even to less experienced gamers. For example, The first main story boss, you can summon a mage named Rogier. This npc will shoot spells at the boss and draw aggro to provide an innate advantage to less experienced players. It is totally okay to absolutely hate this game if that is your opinion, but when you get frustrated and quit after 5-10 hours of playing, then proceed to write a negative review on the game, your opinion becomes invalid.",10,2022-03-10,PLAYSTATION 5
heretohatetlou2,"It started fun but dropped off severely when its gameplay put itself through a wringer. High intensity fights let large issues shine through. This is on PS5. There is the atrocious combo of input delay accompanied by input stacking. You are punished for playing reactively rather than predictively, despite reaction based gameplay being a large part of souls-like games. The input delay can get you slammed with unfair hits you would have dodged otherwise, and then the input stacking will take the action you WANTED to do, and force you to do it after it's needed, at a time where it will most likely cost you. This game is on next gen and has been in development for 13 years with tons of FromSoft release to learn from. There is no excuse for this poor design and such simple technical issues. It could be so much better, but the way it limits itself through these issues makes it unfun and awkward.",3,2022-03-10,PLAYSTATION 5
Daarkan,"2nd souls game after Demon Souls (remake) 50 hr deep , amazing game . Amazing art design, amazing gameplay , needs commitment . Yeah, the graphics are not RDR2 level, but they don't need to be , and I think it would be bad for the game if it had hyperrealistic graphics with the type of content it presents. If you like spoonfeeding games this is not for you . This is a game where you can expres and explore at your own pace!!",10,2022-03-10,PLAYSTATION 5

BenShar,"This being my first souls type game (I had dabbled in dark souls but don’t enjoy linear games too much ARPG or RPG with as much player agency as possible is my preferred game style) I was expecting a lot of pain and upset, however after realising that you can build you character anyway you want and have no direction I was initially a bit concerned. That concerned turned out to be unnecessary, as I progressed started attempting mini bosses and dungeon bosses I began to understand the game. There is a steep learning curve which if you can’t keep up with or don’t give it a chance then you will not reap the benefits. Yes there are minor performance issues but I have had nothing game breaking other than slow texture renders when galloping around on Torrent. The graphics can be a bit lack lustre but I believe the art style can justify this. Once you begin to get better you begin to enjoy the game more I can see a reason anyone would score this game as badly as some reviews have other than people being bitter, and not researching the game before it came out. I mean if you think it looks bad or don’t enjoy the gameplay you can only blame yourselves. The trailers showcases the aesthetic and you should know what to expect by just watching or playing previous FromSoftware games. Once you actually learn the game, understand movement and use your **** brain you realise it’s better than 95% of the **** other developers are spewing out there ****",9,2022-03-10,PLAYSTATION 5

Sean_D,"I'm writing this review as a BIG fan of From Software games. I feel like it's necessary to preface that I've played Demon's Souls on PS3, Dark Souls, DS 2, DS 3, Bloodborne, Sekiro, the Demon's Souls remake...I really like these games. I platinumed Bloodborne. I thought Sekiro was good, but I found it more difficult than all of the other From games. So...take into account that this is coming from someone that has been ""conditioned"" to play these games. OK, with that out of the ****! This game is refreshing in the way Breath of the Wild (I know, I know...that comparison is made far too often) was when it came out. Recently, I restarted Horizon: Zero Dawn, because I wanted to finish that game in preparation of Forbidden West coming out. The problem I was running into with H: ZD was that the open world doesn't incentivize the player to explore. **** could. But why? What would you find? Nothing exciting. Open world games need to have a sense of curiosity in the world they drop you in. This idea is similar to the feeling I had when Fallout 3 first came out. I remember sitting in my dorm room, roaming the wasteland. Blood pumping as I'd approach another monument or DC location of interest. They made their open world interesting by contrasting with what is already familiar with the player. While the world of Elden Ring is far from anything that may be familiar to the player, the game finds its own way to do what all open world games need to do. It gives the player a sense of curiosity for its world. You find yourself exploring the countryside, when all of the sudden, the sky turns red. The scenery has a satanic, off-putting sense that makes you feel uncomfortable and that maybe you shouldn't be there. Regardless, you explore, because despite feeling uncomfortable about where you are, you still want to find out what the area has to offer. On a similar note, you find a building that is semi-falling apart. You find the entrance and turns out what's inside is an elevator. You take the long ride down, deep into an underground world you couldn't have known existed. Magical in the serenity it provides. Despite being underground, you look up into a sea of stars. Somehow, it exists despite not making ""sense."" You see a castle far into the distance, and decide that while the journey to it may not be easy, the fact that reaching it all is possible is gratifying. Something that I can appreciate is not only is the world full of ""wow, this is magical"" moments. It also has moment of ""laugh out loud,"" wow, this is ridiculous moments. The first time I came across a building sitting on a walking crater with a bell that gongs with every step it takes, I remember thinking ""Wow,"" but also a laugh and a ""WTF."" A lot of the churches in the game have an NPC to greet you upon entering. To my surprise, I entered a church to find a giant turtle sporting a hat similar to the Pope's. I described this to my wife and told her that if she ever hears me randomly laughing while playing that it's because I came across something like that. Sorry, I know I haven't even starting talking about anything outside of it's world yet. I'm boring when it comes to these games. I play sword and shield. I made my generic-looking younger, brown haired warrior. The character creation suite is undoubtedly their most extensive yet. If you want to fine tune your avatar's chin line, go nuts. Make what you picture to be the most perfect-looking person. Make the most freakish looking monster you could conjure. The combat is standard Dark Souls affair. And either I'm getting better at dodge-rolling or the game is more forgiving. That's not to say that the creative enemies and bosses aren't without their challenges. The game allows you to have other players help you with difficult fights. With it being an aspect of the game, I'll welcome any help I can find. One aspect of the open world that isn't present in other From Software games is that you may find yourself missing areas in early parts of the world, only to come back after a good amount of leveling and looting. Now a boss that might've at one point presented a challenge at one point is easily steamrolled. I write this having not completed the game at this point, but the vastness and level of intrigue this game presents hasn't been met by anything I've played in a long time. I'm saddened that someone that isn't ready for how to play this won't be able to appreciate that magic it provides, but as someone that can appreciate that, this is my game of the year. Maybe my game of the last 5 to 10 years. I'm sorry if the frustration doesn't allow to find the magic. But, if you're ready, prepare yourself for some of the most gratifying gaming experiences you've had in a while. Fantastic game!",10,2022-03-10,PLAYSTATION 5
Nuhman1990,"So far horizon FW and Elden ring is the 10/10 for me!! This is not that mean it doesn’t have any bug or not! Obviously there is some bug, main reason why I like this game is exploring world giving you real adventures and curious what is in this area!! I find this on horizon forbidden west and elden ring so far!! Maybe because I love open world games!! And people overreact to the difficulty this game is not that much difficult compare to sekiro!! Many people wants to beat the game smoothly and beat all the bosses on their first or second try but nature of this game dying and learning the movements and defeat, once you get this you might be frustrate some point but not disappointed because that’s what we love and expect in this game!!

The map is huge, and while it might seem empty if you start looking you will find fully fleshed out mini-dungeons with fun and hard bosses at the end. The combat just feels like a more refined Dark Souls 3, which is exactly what I wanted, and all of the weapon arts and ashes of war make each fight interesting, rather than just spamming basic attacks. If you have a good enough computer you'll be able to see how good this game looks, and it's obvious how much work they put into the art. The story, which is somewhat hidden from the player like in the other soul's games, seems coherent and interesting at least from what I have played.

Very little is explained, zero guidance on aims or what anything is or does - Controls are clunky and sometimes unresponsive.

Eclipse4444,"An open world game must sacrifice some aspects due to the sheer size of the world they're creating. Unfortunately, much of what made the Dark Souls series so good has been lost or greatly reduced. Intricate, well thought out level design is now rare. Most of the various dungeons, castles, mines, and other environments are pretty straight forward. Enemy and boss design seems to have suffered as well. Almost every minor boss is fought numerous times, which kills any sort of uniqueness they had. Also, it feels like the developers are constantly trying to one up themselves. Every major boss has to have an over the top moveset that does a million damage, particle effects, and soundtrack. I am not asking for an easy mode, but I am asking for some competent game design. Overall, it's fine. The first 20 hours are great, but the rest gets tedious. To see such a great developer make a game filled with baffling and outright bad design choice, makes me unable to go above a 7/10.",7,2022-03-10,PLAYSTATION 5

coffee_warden,"Elden Ring was extremely hyped up before release, and usually that leads to a let down fan base, but in this case, it delivered. Its exactly what I wanted from it. Initially I was getting a bit of frame stutter (maybe once an hour lasting a couple seconds), but this seems to be gone now. To date, it is the single best game I have ever played. Pros - The open world is massive - There's an insane amount of optional content. - The game is more accessible ever. More casual fans can grind out levels while exploring, as opposed to grinding the same enemies over and over, making the experience more engaging - The combat system has been expanded upon in a thoughtful way that adds variety in builds - The minimalist UI and hand holding lead to a more immersive experience - Plenty of bosses that are difficult enough to feel rewarding without feeling like the fight is unfair Cons - Cycling target lock appears bugged. Some enemies are just out of reach to cycle onto, but if you unlock, move the camera slightly and then lock again, you can target them. Target lock range should be based on player position and whether the target is on the camera, not if they are close enough to the center of the camera. - Azur Comet needs to be nerfed In short, praise the message!",10,2022-03-10,PLAYSTATION 5
Symphony93,"This is honestly one of the best games that I have ever played. As of the time of writing, I have over 85 hours in the Lands Between. After reading a couple of the other reviews on here, there are some things that I would like to address from my perspective. Graphics: The graphics in this game are absolutely gorgeous. What makes this statement true for me is the art direction. The masterful use of the full color palate had me literally putting my controller down to just take in what I was looking at. While the textures are high quality, they are not as high as other games and I suspect that this is where the complaint originates. Empty World: If a reviewer is using the phrase ""empty world,"" they either have not played the game or define empty very differently than I do. This game is bursting at the seams with content. While this may not be readily apparent as there will be no map markers, their are dungeons littering the map, ranging from relatively small to insanely expansive. An example from the first area: I discovered a well with an elevator. After beginning to ride the lift, I realized that it was going so much further down than I could have ever predicted. When it finally came to a stop, I was in a completely new area of the game, where I needed to find a new piece of the map. This was all under a different masterfully packed open world area. Almost all of these dungeons culminate with a new boss encounter. The map is also full of ruins/encampments to defeat, bosses roaming the map, as well as unique encounters that only happen at certain times of day. I spent almost 20 hours exploring the opening area ALONE. Repetitive Combat: In FROMSOFT games, the combat is defined typically by spamming the button for light attacks. This is made more enjoyable by the unique enemy design. Unlike most games, souls games were able to introduce (at least one but normally at least 2) new enemy types in every single area of the game. This doesn't sound like a lot until you realize DS1 had 24 areas to explore before the DLC came out. Elden Ring is not only much larger, with exponentially more areas and unique enemies, but it also has more unique weapons with expansive move sets, AND DEEPER COMBAT after adding the posture break mechanic, jump attacks, guard counters, customizable weapon abilities and mounted combat. This does not even include the completely revamped magic system with countless spells. Good luck fellow Tarnished!",10,2022-03-10,PLAYSTATION 5

BanzBanana,Elden Ring is the best game of this year so far no doubt. The Gameplay is so good! The freedom of open world is astonishing asis the world. By playing Astrologer it allows you to enjoy this World without getting your ass kicked every time. Great Game. I am like 25 hours in and I love it. It pretends to be the best game ever for me. But so far Witcher 3 keeps its position. As of right now it is second when it comes to Gameplay and beauty of the world. Edit: I finished it. Took me like 90 hours but it was totally worth it.

Venxas23,"La obra definitiva de Fromsoftware hasta la fecha. Recoje y mejora todo lo que hace a todos los otros juegos buenos, brindando una increíble experiencia de fantasía con una ambientación que te atrapa. Las nuevas mecánicas cómo el salto y el combate a caballo (que si bien ya existían desde hace mucho tiempo en los videojuegos, mas elden ring los utiliza de modo excepcional) funcionan fe forma increíble, y abren un gran abanico de posibilidades tanto a la movilidad cómo a la exploración o al combate, ya que están muy bien aprovechadas. Sin ir mas allá, solo las magias, cosa que ya existía en todos los juegos de Dark Souls, aquí se sienten totalmente distintas. Son ágiles y útiles y jugar cómo mago realmente genera una sensación satisfactoria, no porque vuelva el juego fácil, sino porque realmente te sientes un mago en un reino de fantasía. Y hablando de la dificultad. Mucho se habló de que iba a ser un juego más fácil, con mas ayudas, etc... Bueno, Gilip*lleces. Es igual de dificil o más que cualquier otro juego de From.

madikc,"Overhyped and overrated game. Not terrible, but not good either. Feels like the From Software put their B team (Dark Souls 2) on this project. To provide context, I think it important to start by saying I've been a huge fan of the SoulsBorne series since the day Demons Souls was released. I've loved the twisted worlds they've created, the way they reward a combination of creativity, observation and reaction. So here are the FromSoft Games I've finished, and my rough grade: - Bloodborne (A+) - Dark Souls (A) - Demon's Souls (A-) - Sekiro (A-) - Dark Souls 3 (B+) - Dark Souls 2 (B-) With that out of the way, let's talk Elden Ring. From early gameplay video I can tell you I was not excited. The new world and GRRM writing seemed interesting, but I kept waiting for the other shoe to drop: what was this game adding to the formula that made it worth developing? That moment never came, but that not stop the world from reaching maximum hype level about it. A minority raised concerns and complaints with these early videos - about the animations looking reused from DS3, the graphics looking subpar, etc - these people were shouted down. I've also noticed some in the community railing against the game, because their favorite cult series suddenly went mainstream and Twitch trash are turning it into the flavor of the month. That is not me. I will admit I have my biases, and count myself in the group that complained about the reused animations and last gen graphics - however neither of those were dealbreakers for me. Pros: - Bite-sized chalice dungeons that reward exploration. - Huge set of weapons and spells. - The mount is cute and controls well. Cons: - Framerate **** on PS5 w/ performance mode - XP feels super grindy. - Mounted combat is not fun. - So many reused bosses. You'll see the exact same boss multiple times during the game, and they didn't even bother making it look different. (Think the Smelter Demon x4) - Bosses push further down the trend that DS3 set, being more about twitch reaction and DPS checks, rather than rewarding smart play. - Bosses and many enemies seem to have endless combos. This makes ranged combat like archery and magic relatively unbalanced. You're almost guaranteed to trade hits with a boss to get any damage in, bucking the 'call-and-response'/observe-punish gameplay that made the series great. - AI feels really cheap. There seems to be 3 levels of AI awareness: Oblivious, aggroed, road raged. Enemies often stand around doing nothing. A lot of enemies have cheap AOE abilities that come out quicker than is possible to react and move out of damage range. These usually are ground stomps, earthquakes caused by weapon slams, etc. The area affected is not well indicated, and feel really cheap. The only way to avoid them is to get lucky with I-frames on your roll. - The world feels really boring. Much of it is empty. Geometry and decorations seem randomly strewn about. Outdoor dungeons make no sense, like in a Dark Souls 2 way. Things will link together in ways that don't make sense. There is even a castle with a big gate and a draw bridge, and when you get inside... you go up an elevator... like wtf... - Most of the NPCs are really generic and boring. Their dialogue writing and voice acting is poor, and they carry on with exposition about meaningless things. - The opening cinematic is a huge step back from other Soulsborne games. - The non-weapon item designs are dumb, and don't seem to fit any sort of cohesive theme like the other games. - UI screens, especially the inventory screens are really poorly designed. They lack the character of previous games. They give you way too much information and not enough at the same time, and navigating them is a real chore of contextual toggle buttons. The font and backgrounds are very generic and lack that FromSoft character. - The item descriptions are now only a single byline sentence, where before they provided so much lore and character to the world, now I don't feel any reason to read them. - The color grading is ugly. - Summoning spells are passive and lame, and really don't fit with the gameplay. - So many encounter and enemy designs have been reused. It honestly feels like a FromSoft greatest hits compilation than any sort of original design. If you're a fan of the series, you'll find yourself saying 'oh hey, that's X from Y game. Only it has been reskinned.' - Some boss fights are a huge chore. Running around the enemy in circles while locked on (a'la Sekiro), getting a single hit in for 1% damage, waiting 30 secs, getting another hit. It's a real slog - even with good upgraded weapons and gear. - The crafting system ****. Costs way too many souls for key ingredients from shopkeepers. Adds nothing of value, and requires you to pick up respawning ingredients on the map - one of my least favorite mechanics in modern games (Elder Scrolls).",5,2022-03-09,PLAYSTATION 5

A couple seemed a little OP, but they could be patched at some point. Really no complaints, once you learn you can't go balls out every time and have to play strategically it gets even better.

ArtemisTwitch,"Honestly breathtaking. On PS5 I have had zero issues. I don't usually write reviews for games on here, but with the sad situation of salty game Devs and their salty fans creating new Metacritic accounts with the sole purpose of review bombing a brilliant game, I wanted to add my two cents. First off, more than one game can be good at any given time. I feel like a lot of people need to hear this. That being said, Elden Ring is one of the few games I have played in recent memory that not only lived up to the hype and promises made, but surpass both, greatly. It is absolutely stunning. FROM has created a world that feels so lived in. This isn't just an open world so it can say it's an open world game, it's an open world that actually doesn't feel empty. Which is shocking if you look at the size of the map! And there are things to discover or miss in every corner of that map. This adds so much to the exploration. The fact that it is left completely up to us, the player, how and where we want to play and/or explore is so refreshing. Just last night, I was running through and area I had been through countless times in my currently over 70 hours of play time, feeling like a God, when I encountered an enemy I had never seen, that promptly ended me and brought me down off my high horse. I was shocked, stunned, and absolutely giddy with excitement. The gameplay is brilliant, they have been refining it over years, and anyone can see it. It is effortless in its execution. Are there changes that could be made? Of course, as with absolutely any game that has ever been made, especially so soon after release. Do they dampen the experience to a point where I, even slightly, don't enjoy the game? Not for even one second. A lot of people have complained that the ""graphics are awful"" and that it's ""absolutely hideous."" These are absolute lies from people really looking for something to complain about. Are the level of the graphics the same as different games recently released? Can you see every strand of hair separately blow in the wind? No you can't, but bad, the graphics are most certainly not! The game is still beautiful! The atmosphere, the story telling, the exploration, the actual game play, and how these all make you as a new tarnished feel while exploring the world for the first time, they are what make this game what it is, brilliant.",10,2022-03-09,PLAYSTATION 5

While I think review bombing on this game is a little unnecessary, I do understand how newcomers to this series will find this game daunting and asking perhaps a little too much. It's never been for everyone, but in a game that you will at least need to commit 70+ hours to, it can be a tall order.

Draclif2,"I LOVE: - how hard the game is by design (it's challenging) - great graphics (ps5) - great scary / tense atmosphere - the use of hiding being a key threat response I don't care for or am frequently frustrated by: - How incredibly easy it is to miss hitting an enemy, even one who is point blank, not moving, cowering on his knees right in front of me. That seems to come from disappointing precision and intent-adjusted collision enablement / detection capabilities I HATE !!! : 1) My friends and I really hate how terrible the multiplayer teaming has been designed. - The open world is not open world for your friends, their only objective is to help you kill an area boss - The process to actually connect a friend to my game or vice versa is among the most labor-intensive of it's kind that I've seen - A death experienced by people in my world fully removes them from my world (aka, my group) and recovery only comes from repeating the laborsome process above - There is no way for friends to sustain each other (no revive, heal requires unreasonable proximity (as do caster dps abilities, no resource / loot sharing) The part we hate is likely to prematurely sour our fun too much and push us away. I value the survival nature of the game but the process used now is really no different than the mobile games that force me to wait time before I can **** are forcing me to wait the time it takes me to find those flowers and make the pieces to summon **** then meander about trying to find where they put their little runes I have to click on.

JONXJON,"Elden Ring is the magnum opus from developer From Software and delivers in every facet. BUT, if you are not accustomed to Souls games or have trouble being left alone in a game with no help this game might not be for you. It's a shame though that people are giving this game negative reviews for minute details such as frame rate drops and difficulty but then negating the vast open world, deep combat system, gameplay mechanics, lore, music, art design, and the many other things this game delivers on. I have played every From Software game and can easily say Elden Ring is the hardest, but if you dedicate your time to exploring the world and the treasures it has to offer, you can easily level up enough to make any boss a cake walk. To touch on the exploration aspect of the game if you choose to not explore the world and rush your way through onto the main bosses you are missing the quintessential part of Elden Ring, the discovery and unfolding lore of the Lands Between. While you ride your spectral steed Torrent you'll see vast mountains with castles, forests, dilapidated churches, and if you can see it you can you can explore it. Much of the gameplay is spent through finding places to loot for items that will make your character stronger to inch their way towards becoming the Elden Lord. The bosses are some of From's best ever, many of them in my most difficult bosses in any game. The side characters give you so much information about the world helping paint the broken fragments of the Lands Between. I can say so much more to exemplify why this game truly is a masterpiece, but my biggest compliment is that I have beaten the game 3 times, earned 100% completion, collected every item, and I cant wait to do it all over again. If you can handle the difficulty and lack of hand holding Elden Ring is a must play game that truly is era defining.",10,2022-03-09,PLAYSTATION 5

ACme01,"Let's start by saying that I played, replayed, and loved the DS games. Let's also preface this with me admitting that I saw the reviews for the game before playing it and that may have affected my expectations. Anyway, I wonder if most of the critics played this on console. I played it on PC and it's very far from the near-perfect experience most of them promised. The controls alone are some of the clunkiest I've seen. G for map, E + an arrow key (and if you're on a 60% keeb, this is really annoying), etc. There's also the way it almost seems designed to make things difficult for you unnecessarily if you're on a KB+M. Yes, I know the usual advice: play it with a controller instead, and so on. But if you release something for PC, you should plan for KB+M. You shouldn't expect your players to have to invest in a controller for a single game that has already cost them $60. It's clear that even after all the critique levelled at them for doing the same thing in DS games, FromSoft still hasn't learned a thing about porting to PC or KB+M play. You'd be astonished how flawless your own gameplay can be only to be interrupted repeatedly by a camera seizing control or the auto-targeting locking onto a mosquito when you're trying to deliver a final blow to a boss. That's my main gripe, but it's not the only one. There's also the frame-skipping and input lag. I haven't died to any bosses yet, but I'm guessing it's only a matter of time before that instability hits me at a critical moment. And I'm on a 5950x with a 3090. Yes, I've heard the argument to just treat this as another hurdle or another level of difficulty to make the game more interesting, by the way. But while I don't mind intentional difficulty, I mind sloppy sources of annoyance. I don't play games to be irritated by someone else's oversights or laziness. Finally, I'm a little let down by parts of the game, I think. I like some things - some things genuinely seem new and add interesting mechanics to the gameplay FromSoft offers. But too many things seem to still be stuck in the DS world. I've seen bosses like these before. I've seen enemies like these before. Maybe the promise of something new and revolutionary got me expecting too much. But this was neither new nor revolutionary. I'm almost done playing through it, and I'm thinking I won't replay it... which isn't how I want to feel after playing an open-world game.",1,2022-03-09,PLAYSTATION 5

Zalkarmus,"IGN Japan's Review was a complete inversion of every truth about the game. It is tedious and filled with chores. Many enemies are merely a part of the scenery. The game encourages dull exploration and then changes it up on a dime with a randomly-placed boss. The game is awful, overrated, is possibly worse than even Dark Souls 2, the black sheep of the Souls family, and that is saying a lot from me, because I think Dark Souls 2 is one of the worst games ever made. A horrifying tour-de-force in how to remain frustrated for 10 hours of your day trying to complete the chore list and 50+ annoying boss encounters. Just as a redditor admitted hitting his wife out of frustration against Margit, the first main boss. The game is awful, terrible, and I cannot stress it enough. Also, there is no story. There's not even a lore. Not even if you look for it. Every single positive reviewer was paid off. This game should never have been made, and George R.R. Martin contributed nothing worthy of note. EDIT: I am making a further edit to my initial impressions. When you take the game in small bits, take your time to explore everything and build up your inventory, and also make sure not to take on Margit, the first primary boss too early, you might find enjoyment. The latter half of the game is very difficult, and once you get to Godskin Duo, you had better be very overleveled. Overall, the beginning of the game is enjoyable, but the second half is balls-to-the-wall hard due to game tuning issues. Edit2: The game further drops off in quality after Limgrave and Weeping Peninsula. Very much DS2 vibes. Overall not good.",5,2022-03-09,PLAYSTATION 5

Iceassassin009,So my brother begged me to play this game with him because we were looking for a new co op game to play together. Though I wasn’t a dark souls fan I caved in because he said it was different. So right out the gate your thrown into battle not being told anything. Ok heard it was a little difficult so I’ll have to learn as I play. Which became one of my issues with the game. It tells you nothing just go. I learned later that there was a tutorial at the beginning. Doesn’t make sense to have it but hide it away from players. In that first hour of playing I tired to join up with my brother to play and neither of us could figure it out. As he watched videos on how to do it I explored some more. I was playing as a mage and what became very annoying was when I ran out of mana I’d tried to use a potion and I was left with an animation where he would just scratch his ass then shrug his shoulders then being killed. This would also happen when trying to use a summon in a boss fight. So we finally got the co op to work and as a mage I was now restricted to only 2 potions and no check points to restore them making me a warrior very quickly in the battle. After beating a boss you are kicked out of the game and must remake the item’s which isn’t hard to rejoin. So realizing that this game would take longer to play in co op we played solo instead. After running into box collecting missions it hit me I have no clue what this world is about and how to find what missions I’ve started. I get the whole you’ll find it when you come across it but I’ve forgot which castles or locations they asked me to go to. Then brought me back to the main story in the game. What is it. Why does everyone I talk to hate me then beg me for help. Why hire someone to help write your story but there is none. So I continued on for another few hours and butt scratching moments when I came across so more issues that I really wasn’t playing attention to at the beginning. The controls are bad. You’ll get locked in a animation. Then when they start to attack and your smashing the dodge. Your number one move in game. Being quickly chopped down. Doesn’t help either when enemies are stuck in the walls or inside chest and can attack you but you can’t hit them. PvP to me is very cheesy and should be for those who wish to play it. After killing a boss and trying to return to a check point I’m interrupted multiple times by another player then losing all my runes. Just to spawn back into game where another player joins game causing me to lose everything I just worked so hard to get. So in end I was left with any butt scratching. I wanted to like this game but couldn’t. Frame rate drops made things more difficult between the multiple rolls and butt scratching I’d go through. Story 1/10 controls 4/10 pve 1/10 pvp 7/10 when wanting to do so. Visually 8/10 sound 9/10. It feels more like a sandbox rpg then anything else.,5,2022-03-09,PLAYSTATION 5
Newklear_Phil,"The design of this game is just on another level. Only complaint might be some needlessly complicated mechanics/lack of explanation, but this may be just a challenging aspect to learn. In fact my entire playthrough so far has been a learning experience, which is so unlike most other games today in which you aren't required to be engaged and thinking to advance. Beautiful graphics, compelling story, stellar gameplay, vast sense of continual discovery and progression, one of the greatest of all time.",10,2022-03-09,PLAYSTATION 5
JohnTomorrow,"Elden Ring is a good game, but it has its share of problems. While playing 100+ hours I've experienced some outstanding highs and lows. I don't think its Fromsoftware's best title but I think its worth a play. Random ramblings to follow: - art direction is awesome but graphically the engine is really showing its age which is a shame. there is only a single directional light for shadows (usually the sun) and the lighting model is no where near the bar for todays next gen games - speaking about the engine, it suffers from performance problems where frame rate tanks during load ins and poor pop in where you can see things like grass and other details be placed in the world spread out over a few frames - design wise the open world mixed with dungeons is a new take which I enjoyed. It was something new. I still prefer the original Dark Souls design as I think it was the purist design but this is something new and I am ok with it. - the first half of the game things are exciting and interesting, but like most open world games, things get repetitive after that. it becomes a repeat of the same dungeons, the same bosses over and over. by then your character is also pretty much setup so there is little reason to continue. the story is nonsense so that is not a motivator - there are real, real problems with how this design has influenced multiplayer. Coop is fine, but invasions are completely broken. They are essentially 3 vs 1 gank squads where the invader has a near zero chance at winning. To win, the invader needs to rely on cheap tactics, luck, or play against someone not very good at the game. When the invader does win it never feels satisfying. Gone are the intense PVP battles from other titles, or the adrenalin rush when someone invades your game. This game played it very safe when it comes to multiplayer and loses one of the core things that make souls games exciting which is very unfortunate. PVP is also very unbalanced, but I don't think really any of Fromsoftware's titles have been so this is not a shocker. But this one does feel the worst as magic and art of war skills are extremely OP. - boss battles are very much a mixed bag. They are better than other titles where you simply try to get behind an enemy and wack its ankles over and over but there are some choices that really do take away from the enjoyment. Every boss has extra delays in the attack animations put in purposely to throw you off. I get it, and I think that is ok for some, but its like that in every fight. Bosses will take to the air in and arial attack and defy gravity for a split second just to make it more difficult. Too much anime for my taste. - Combat suffers from a general lack of polish and laziness from Fromsoftware. Enemies will attack straight through walls as if they don't exist. Many times, you might not even be able to see an attack coming because it was through a pillar. Its feels incredibly lazy not to add a line of sight check and creates an unfair bad feeling. Bad feeling moments crops up in many places throughout the game. For example, during one boss fight due to a bug with the character movement code, I kept getting stuck on a tiny step in the environment while trying to run or roll that would allow the boss to kill me (it only takes 1-2 hits from a boss to kill you which is another thing). There is a bunch of jank that should have been found and fixed in QA or by now being how many games Fromsoftware has made in this style by now. The player should feel like they lost due to a mistake they made, not due to lack of polish in the game's systems or a bug. As a game developer myself, I am surprised with how much Fromsoftware can get away with. This is essentially the same combat and physics system they had dating back to the original Demon Souls. Anyway, its still a good game but I am slightly disappointed. The sense of scale and exploration is awesome but these issues tarnish a really good game. The mishandling of the PVP design was the nail in the coffin for me. Without a solid PVP design I have little motivation to put in anymore time in to this game.",7,2022-03-09,PLAYSTATION 5
Ringzn1979,"In the run-up, there was great enthusiasm, as none other than ""Game of Thrones"" author George RR Martin had co-written the story for the fantasy game. What ""Elden Ring"" delivers is almost cheeky: A magic ring broke, evil monsters grabbed the fragments. At least hobbits don't have to make their way... The main plot of the game is clear, boring and predictable, George RR Martin's commitment (who only wrote the background story of the environment mentioned) was apparently little more than a PR stunt. Anyone who has seen titles like ""Horizon Forbidden West"" or ""Halo Infinite"" will be disappointed with the graphics of ""Elden Ring"". Textures are muddy, objects keep popping up instead of appearing smooth as you approach them, and the design of each region is more reminiscent **** designed for the previous generation of hardware. Anyone who likes to fail will love ""Elden Ring"". The game punishes even small mistakes with brutal severity, while at the same time being stingy with tips and explanations. So you have to work hard for each fight, start over and over again and blindly search for the optimal combination of tactics, equipment and timing in order to slay the many bosses. Overall, ""Elden Ring"" is only for real hardcore gamers. Anyone who likes to charge against the same monster twenty times will love the title. Even fans of an open game world should definitely take a look at this game. But one thing should be clear to everyone: ""Elden Ring"" is actually not a ""game"", but bitter seriousness.",5,2022-03-09,PLAYSTATION 5
Mugix,"Please, do not listen to the resentful people who criticize this game because they are not able to pass the first zone of the game because it is too difficult or because the game has a fps pull every 7 hours.

Phox_,"The perfect amalgamation of all the previous souls games. They took the best parts of bloodborne and ds3 and combined it with some new mechanics. Finally we are able to more freely play with build experimentation in a single play through. No limits to respects mean every time you want to adjust or change your build you can. Map traversal is more rewarding than ever for exploration and at the same time more simple thanks to statues and graces being so abundant. Not having to run back through whole levels just to get back to a boss is a huge improvement from previous titles. I think they’ve proved you can have a open world game that’s not just the same copied garbage over and over. I’m over a hundred hours in and I still keep finding secrets that I missed and encounters that I wouldn’t expect out in the middle of seemingly nowhere. To date, this is the best game in the franchise, and that’s saying something since bloodborne is still my favorite game.",10,2022-03-09,PLAYSTATION 5
NitrogenLlama,The game is near perfect… in most areas. There are definitely some enemies and quite a few bosses that are less than fun to encounter because they have long unpredictable attacks with very narrow and misleading openings during which you can attack. Also I very much dislike instances of non-player character interactions happening with no consent of the player. Exploring the map shouldn’t have a chance of holding your runes hostage because you wandered into an invasion you might not even know is possible with a lot of runes. The game does have compelling combat that gives genuine satisfaction when you defeat a hard enemy or boss! Even if they felt unfair you still feel so accomplished after you win on the first try or after dozens of deaths. The game is beautiful and rich with themes and flavor! The game is a 9/10 without the flawed enemy encounters mentioned above. An 8/10 with them. I would totally recommend it to anyone who can take many failures without losing faith.,8,2022-03-09,PLAYSTATION 5

Magus509,"Phenomenal open-world experience Elden Ring combines the intense Souls-style combat From Software is known for with a world that rivals in size to Skyrim. I've spent 60+ hours traversing the various locations within the game and I am STILL finding things I missed before! With a varied skill tree and no real guard rails, every player is capable of having their own unique experience, exploration and perseverance are rewarded with powerful weapons, spells, armor, side quest progression and new areas to explore. PC players be cautious, the port is not perfect, and due to it's current popularity the servers are overwhelmed. However I find it very hard to criticize this game given the scope and effort put into it. Probably the biggest reason I recommend this game is due to the social aspect surrounding it. You WILL see and do things your friend might miss, and the UI is meant to be communicated amongst players. Multiplayer is it's own unique experience, and the game (like prior titles) allows you to leave helpful messages for future adventurers to read.

Sanz_22,"1. A boring repetitive empty giant open world. Generic and recycled bosses and enemies; 2. The same old-style FromSoftware way of telling a story: a boring puzzle that has to be solved through reading hundreds of items descriptions and cryptic conversations with stoned NPCs; 3. Clunky combat system and light-speed bosses from Tekken: rolling through infinite AoE attack combos just to land one or two strikes, repeat; 4. Few pieces of equipment and terrible drop rates. You kill a boss just to receive some useless material; 5. Very beautiful art direction, BUT terrible graphics; 6. Poor performance; 7. Different from Dark Souls, and the others, Elden Ring is mediocre at building tension. Dark Souls is a game that has you always under pressure, theres is little to no rest. You can only feel safe when you're resting at a bonfire. When you play for the first time, you never know what to expect. Enemies are strategically placed, as well as traps. And they're everywhere, all the time. Elden Ring can't do this. There are long pauses to ""commune with nature"", because the big empty open world is not threatening. You can see the enemies from distance, and you're never caught by surprise. The way from Ruin A to Ruin B is safe and sound... And once you approach Ruin B, you know ""ok, now I'll face some challenge"", at this moment, there's no tension, it was ruined by the anticipation. You always know what to expect and when; 8. Multiplayer is the same old song: dependant on consumable items and limited to smoke walls. FS could have delivered a true multiplayer, but they are too addicted to the same old colorful phantoms paradigma. Am I saying the game is not good? No, I'm not. I'm just convicted that Elden Ring is far from being the Eight World Wonder that media wants it to be. Way too far from 97 on Metacritic. In my opinion, the worst among it's siblings.",5,2022-03-09,PLAYSTATION 5
PhillusMaximus,"The beste game from Miyazaki so far and it doesn't deserve this low user score. given, this game (just like any other soulsborne game), is not intended to be liked by everyone. from software (or in particular Miyazaki) creates worlds where they establish their (oftentimes twisted) fantasies which happened to be liked by a small community. this community grew over the past years larger and larger (probably because more and more people got tired of plain guided 0815 story games) to a point, where elden ring created so much hype, that a lot of people from outside the community got **** in. so naturally, there are people that expected their standard game format and got not even closely to what they expected. no questlog, way too hard, no quick safe, blah blah blah... but to complain about a game not being what you expected, even though you had no idea what you could expect from the franchise, is a bit hypocritical. that's like buying need for speed and complaining it's no race simulator like gran turismo. so yeah, i think the critics score and the player score are both reasonable, but not fair. the critics knew what was coming and reviewed it under known aspects of the franchise, while the user score results due to the mentioned misconceptions. to me, this game is all i could have ever asked for. i love digging into the lore and trying to find out wtf is happening, as well as having to form a strategy to beat a boss, instead of just spamming my best move over and over (let's ignore the sword of night and flame for sec). but i get it, people don't like it because it's not the casual entertainment you can relax to for an hour after work (or school), just coming down and not having to put too much time or brain in. so in conclusion: the game doesn't deserve the negative feed-back it gets, but I can understand where it's coming from. nonetheless, this is the best game from software has published so far! im already past 50+ hours into it and haven't even closely finished my first run.",10,2022-03-09,PLAYSTATION 5

Descubrir zonas con enemigos nuevos y creativos no me llena. Quiero saber el porque estan ahi, que esta pasando, la historia detras de eso. El juego es muy continuista en jugabilidad pero logro entrelazar bien las zonas y el mundo para formar un verdadero monstruo de mundo, enorme y lleno de zonas hermosas, sin embargo al apostar por seguir siendo Souls, mundo obscuro y tenebroso se pierde bastante de lo que pudo haber sido.

bojangled157,"Full discloser, I'm a huge fan of the ""soulsborne - shadows die a bunch series"". I've got 100's of hours in the souls trilogy, platinum trophy in Sekiro and Bloodborne, and i'm about 3/4 through the Demons Souls remake. that being said, i hate game hype. i see hype trains and avoid them like the plague because I am typically disappointed in the end result. So, i avoided any hype for Elden Ring and went in to this game completely blind, just because i trust the developers track record. And my goodness. This game has taken a format that i love and somehow has polished it and tweaked it to become one of the most satisfying games i think i've ever played. Open world games have become fairly cookie-cutter in the last decade or so and i was very suspicious about what direction this game would take. would it be dark souls with towers to climb and 1000 collectibles to check off a list? with fetch quests and objective markers? everything we know to be part of the AAA open-world space? nope, they spat in the face of the norm, even alienating some potential player in the process, to make something that actually feels fresh and new in a space that is mired in the old. Sure, it feels like dark souls, combat wise, but it's polished and rebalanced to feel like something familiar but new. and its take on the open world is something that i didn't even know i was looking for. No hand holding, no clear cut paths or clunky fetch quests, no repetitive checklist collectibles. just a beautiful, brutal, hand crafted world that you get dumped in to and have to forge your own path and adventure. Truly one of the greatest games to come out in recent history, if not a contender for best game of all time.",10,2022-03-09,PLAYSTATION 5

I just cannot describe how good that feels, the exploration is so rewarding. You can skip an entire areas without ever knowing if you won't take your time exploring.

OG_Xonic,"It is extremely rare in a sand box game to actually make you want to explore EVERY inch of a map after over 30 hours of playing I am still going over every hill, around every corner off the beaten path searching for everything and anything as this game rewards you for exploring in ways games by ubisoft or even breathe of the wild didn't do. The combat/difficulty of some bosses yes will cause you to be frustrated, have you turn around and continue your quest in another direction till you come back and get that sweet satisfaction of victory after levelling and memorizing a bosses move sets, that's just part of the game. No, not for everyone but if you're at the start of the game and feeling stuck and frustrated I urge you to grind out a few levels (just go explore guaranteed you've missed a lot) and keep at it, the games difficulty steeply plateaus out after the first boss as you get the hang of not panic dodging and this game absolutely just takes you away. Few games **** you in to the world like this one anymore and that's all without lengthy huge cinematic pieces that spoon feed you all the gaming storylines. Is a ten score a bit of an exaggeration? Maybe and ONLY due to minor graphical stuttering I've experienced but with the amount of people reviewing this game poorly simply due to their inability to learn how to play this game I feel good about bumping this from a 9 to a 10 since we all know games just come out a little rough at the start. There is nothing in the core game that needs to be fixed, just some smoothing out of some bugs and we have a masterpiece on our hands.",10,2022-03-09,PLAYSTATION 5

But there is no deep story to it. Just figure out how and defeat the bosses. Why? Because they exist. Open-world just let you choose which bosses you want to fight. I prefer games with stories not just open-world full of different types of creatures to defeat. I prefer games with technical innovation, graphical innovation, deep story, intriguing conversations and characters. The graphics is outdated, the combat system is outdated and there is no story. So why my high score? This game can be mindless fun. When Witcher 3 was created it was innovative in the time of creation. This game is not innovative. It's innovative Dark Souls game.

Gaming_Potato,"This game is a masterpiece and deservers the score. It's probably the best game I've ever played and I have already over 100 hours. The gameflow, gameplay, combat is perfection. They took the best from all souls games and created a magnum opus in terms of combat. The enemys/bosses and areas are so amazing and detailed that I am still stunned when I look at it. Cinematics are awesome and it has so much good content, that it blew my mind. The quests and story is also wonderful and I was never more into a game as Elden Ring overall. Definetely a 10/10. Now lets talk about the current ""controvery"": Some Game devs (Especially the sore loosers at ubisoft) badmouthed this game with various untrue reasons like: missing UI, bad graphics, overhyped by game critics and so on (,while being unable to make good games theirself). Saddest part is, that some ubi-fanboys are reviewbombing this game and giving their favourite ""open world game"" perfect score. They usually copy ubisofts and over devs words and just add the ""bad performance"" part for PC, which mostly has been fixed for people above min. reqiurements. If you don't like it or even hate the game, I guess it's okay if you give like a 5. But it shouldn't be objectively possible to give below 5 because it's in every aspect amazing. Now to all the Fanboys/Clowns: If you really hate it, it's okay. Taste is objective. If you think the game is bad because of gameplay or graphics then you didn't know what game you bought in the first place and you are a fool. If the game doesn't run smoothly, next time read the System requirements, which they posted like 1 week even before release. If you cry about UI, lore or just copy the stupid/false words from the ""devs"", just go to your corner and play your easy/boring/bad microtransaction games with 800 questmarker/waypoints on the map where you just follow a path like a bot without thinking/playing yourself. If that's the case, you are the reason why gaming gets bad and gives money to those big ""triple A"" companys, who exploit clowns like you. If you want to fight me in an argument about this, just add me on steam or write me a comment there. Can't wait how many clowns are going to write ""interesting stuff"" and white knight their favourite game in comparison to elden ring. ****/id/Gaming_Potato",10,2022-03-09,PLAYSTATION 5

wastelandviking,"After 80 hours I enjoyed the challenge of this game but aside from the graphics this game has nothing new to offer. The story line is weak the characters have zero development and the world becomes boring after awhile. I thought this was going to a MMORPG type of game but found the game to be extremely lonely, and not only is there zero NPCs but pretty much all the enemies are the same everywhere you go. Armor Sets are ugly some people will say they're cool but running around in ghoul armor isn't really for me. IDK if you like to cuss out your TV after dying for 6 hours straight and then find a brief moment of victory is your thing then this game is for you. I'm going back to Cyberpunk 2077 and will hope that AC Dawn Of Ragnarok will be better than it's previous DLC content. I enjoy a good story with characters that bring life to it - Elden Ring is not for me I guess but I feel the reviews on this game is too high- guess it's what happens when you release a game with zero bugs",4,2022-03-09,PLAYSTATION 5

HassanLevel100,"This game is the most overhyped trash I ever played in my entire life! The frame rate is never stable on PS5, it doesn't have haptic feedback or adaptive triggers, and the graphics doesn't look anything special, games from two years ago like Ghost of Tsushima and even God of War from 2018 looks so much better,. The multiplayer system is the worst I ever encountered in a game, if the host or the guest dies , they both get disconnected, and you can't play with a friend for 2 minutes straight without getting invaded by someone who is extremely over leveled above you both, which in turn will kill you easily and get you disconnected again, totally not fun! The bosses in this game are poorly designed as well, there is always a spirit character that you can summon before the fight to use him as a distraction for the boss, while you are attacking him from the back over and over til it dies, not to mention you can also summon your own spirits to do more distraction for you, there is no ""gitting gud"" in this bull**** game, it's terribly designed and doesn't deserve 10/10 at all! Not even close! I would give it a 6/10 at best, but because I hated it so much I'll give it a 0/10, it's the worst most overhyped game I ever played, I regret buying it and if this is what is considered to be the new high standards in gaming, then the gaming industry is truly F*****! The combat in this game is also very cluncky, you can't cancel your animations once you pressed a button, and the dodge and run actions are mapped to the same button as well, it's just very cluncky controls and totally unnecessary! Save your money and do not buy this overrated garbage. The only positives I had in this game are the character creation system, and the world map is designed well, that's it!

Tzelanit,"I'm always the type to laugh off and disregard scores of either 10 or 0 because very few games either are revolutionary instant classics or irredeemable garbage, but after 116 hours of play time (yes, I not only actually played a game before reviewing it, but completed it before I left a review like a sensible human being,) Elden Ring gets a 10. I became familiar with the souls formula back in 1996 while playing King's Field II, and over the years, FromSoft games have become more refined with each subsequent entry. Each game that they've released has provided a great balance of something that feels familiar, but with a little more to consider. There's been a slow, natural evolution in their design principles that have very rarely disappointed. So it's with 26 years of experience with FromSoft's entries that I feel comfortable saying that this comes as close as we've ever seen to these design principles being perfected. The leap in approach between each souls game has never been this substantial. Whereas before you had to dedicate yourself to mastering a very specific path through the world, Elden Ring provides an experience where you grow to learn the world on your terms and in the order that you choose. The guiderails are still in place, but you're encouraged to step over them, and the feeling of ""what's around the next corner?"" is actually somehow exponentially increased with this new open-world design. And speaking of open-world games, I typically don't enjoy them because they devolve into henpicky busywork where you're only playing a game to meet a quota, and exploring is typically unrewarding in both an emotional sense, and in a material sense in the way of lacking rewards. In Elden Ring, your time is never wasted if you check around the next bend. The world is large, but it doesn't exist just to create the illusion of scale; there's something to look at or find in every corner that further contributes to the experience. A grand majority of the negative reviews that I've seen have been from people who so clearly hate souls games because they're challenging and have been parroting the same talking points for years. ""The games are designed so poorly"" actually means ""I can't fulfill my power fantasy by walking into a room and effortlessly killing 50 enemies"" ""I have enough stress in my life and I don't need to play a hard game because games are supposed to be fun"" actually means ""I have too much pride to learn a game on its terms because I should be in full control of the experience."" And finally, ""these games are so bad"" and anything similar to that notion actually means ""I've never played any of those games, but people have said that they're hard and that doesn't interest me, and I'm tired of hearing about them because their popularity offends me."" If you're having a bad day, just read a few of the negative user reviews. You're going to notice a lot of whining children who've clearly never beaten, let alone played a souls game recycling the same handful of hilarious points. I had to take my dog to the vet for surgery today and I was feeling a bit down, but scrolling through these user reviews and seeing ""WHAT KIND OF SICK INDIVIDUAL ENJOYS GAMES WITH IMPOSSIBLE DIFFICULTY?"" with a 0 scored attached really brightened my day. I've had the time of my life playing Elden Ring, and Miyazaki and the rest of the FromSoft team are laughing all the way to the bank while you drench yourself in your own tears throwing a tantrum.

Bark-the-Human,"This game would've been truly amazing had they added true co-op and abandoned the Darks Souls co-op system. A lot of people have been wanting a decent fantasy coop experience for years, and Elden Ring made it seem like it was going to be the first to do one right, but the co-op system is horrendous. They make you jump through pointless hoops than actually making the game harder. You'll be blocked by some magic fog wall, have to kick your friend out, walk five feet into the cave and summon them back in. I was highly annoyed by that, but what really got me, was the fact that they block co-op altogether in a region after defeating the region boss. Co-op was a selling point for me when I bought this game, but the devs didn't bother to mention all of these restrictions. Most of the elitists will say, ""but co-op makes the game easier, and that's bad."" Well, all ya gotta do is make the enemies tougher. There, fixed. The way they implemented the co-op seem like the devs have some personal vendetta against people who want to play with their friends. It's an open-world game, and ya'll should adapt to that. The game has the potential to be the best fantasy game since Witcher 3 came out. If they fix this ridiculous co-op system, I will give this game the highest rating possible.",4,2022-03-08,PLAYSTATION 5

Never could understand the mechanics. Now enter Elden Ring, and this game has blown me away. I love the simplistic ui. Nothing to tell me where to go or what to do. I love the change. I love figuring things out for myself and this is simply perfect. The games combat mechanics are not for the faint of heart and take some getting used to. It’s far from fast paced.

The open world is big, but it doesn't invite you to explore and seems uninspiring and dull. Graphically, the game is quite okay but compared to other open world games again only average and not contemporary. The gameplay can be described as follows: You fight overpowered super agile enemies with ground gymnastics and stupid jumping around and get killed dozens of times. How anyone can like this gameplay is beyond me. The controls are garbage, a tutorial is completely missing, the interface is the total opposite of intuitive and you have to Google all the important information.

Dwideshrude1,"Well, on to the 6th review of Elden Ring (since Metacritic deletes any reviews for cold hard cash) This game is unacceptabley rough. Anyone who plays it will agree the platforming is in an unacceptable state. The environments interefere with gameplay in unintended ways CONSTANTLY. Dropped frames will **** with your gameplay A LOT. Also, From did NOT balance this game, seemingly at all. No matter what health, or defense, armor, etc. 1 shots are guaranteed, and at other times bosses can be 2 shot by you..... Its literally one of the least polished games ive played in decades maybe. This game has the worst input lag, and dropped inputs, i've seen...well since...sekiro. Sekiro dropped inputs constantly, this game doesnt do it as much, but the input lag is 1000000 times worse. Nearly unplayable. Bloodhounds step and summons exist to mask this.Anyone will agree after playing,this game needed more time in the oven. If you arent willing to admit that, you are lying, or From told you couldnt say anything negative, or youd lose access. Play on the horse and platform around for 5 minutes and that ALONE will tell you all you need to know. Input buffer has seemingly gotten worse (somehow) with subsequent updates. Dropping the score down to unplayable. I cant express how unfathomabley uncomfortable the input buffer is. Its unconscionable",0,2022-03-08,PLAYSTATION 5

From soft has perfected the sense of adventure and curiosity with such a dense world. It is a challenging game that fills you with adrenaline when you overcome it. There’s a lot of talk about accessibility but out of all the from soft games, this one is the most flexible and easier to follow. If you are having a hard time, explore, level up, get better gear or upgrade, play with friends or strangers. There are tons of options and customizability. Magic feels great, tanking feels great, weaving in and out feels great. And you can respec 1/3rd in the game, if you change your mind on a build. For old fans of the genre, this is like a celebration of everything that was loved about the previous games. 10/10 for me. Easy.",10,2022-03-08,PLAYSTATION 5
NorwoodShadow,This game is the Magnum Opus of From Software. An accumulation of everything they have done and learned to date and presented in an enormous package. The scale of the world feels incredible and the area/world design is second to none. The combat is similar to Dark Souls 3 with slight changes such as a jump button and guard counters and more. There are always things to nitpick but there will not be a game this year or likely next that captures my attention quite like this. Be prepared to be left in awe by every new location you discover. And there will likely be some that you miss. Same world design philosophy as Dark Souls 1 in a much larger scale.,10,2022-03-08,PLAYSTATION 5

ddeerreekk,"The world is large, full of surprises, spells are cool, storyline is epic. If it weren't a FromSoftware game, I might give it a 8 or even 9. BUT. Elden ring's combat system is a full disaster. After the success of Bloodborne and Sekiro, I can't believe FromSoftware is actually selling this defected, boring and somewhat unendurable combat system. Skills are way more powerful than basic attacks and eventually melee weapons are nothing different from staffs, they are just skill casters. Weapon movesets don't matter at all because no one will use R1/R2 when L2 has larger range, higher damage and even faster speed. Without those broken skills/spells/ashes, our tarnished is basically nothing different from the ashen one in Souls 3, while the bosses has Bloodborne-level mobility. But with these skills, you can just beat any boss on the first try without even knowing what the boss does. I highly doubt that FromSoftware didn't really test the game thoroughly. If FromSoftware really wanted the players to make use of skills in their fights, I am totally fine with that and I think it's a good change. There are a lot of ways to do this, they can let players equip many skills like spells, or merge skills into weapon's movesets, or even just allow players to use left hand weapon skills. Any change on the combat system accommodating the use of skills is good. But FromSoftware didn't change the skill system at all, not even a single bit, instead they just brutally dump in a bunch of overpowered skills and force players to use those skills or else suffer. Not to mention how imba some skills are and how many bugs there are causing some weapons to be either OP or not playable at all. They showed that they can make a good combat system in Bloodborne and Sekiro, but choose not to in Elden ring. This is what really disappoints me.",6,2022-03-08,PLAYSTATION 5

Sloantron,"I think the question you should ask before purchasing Elden Ring (or reviewing it) is asking why you play video games? People clearly enjoy this game but to rate it as one of the best games of all time only makes you qualify that in some way. Almost every positive review I see discuss From Software and it's prior games as a way to explain why they love it. That's all well and good- but rating it as a 10/10 implies that a game succeeds by essentially ever measure. I simply can't comprehend that for this game. The combat is tough but rewarding and there are certainly amazingly designed monsters and battles. That's the draw it seems. I played for hours and that's just not enough for me. I simply wasn't having fun because it lacks the things I love in an RPG. Character development is non-existent and your initial character choice makes little difference in the long run. The overall story is extremely vague and expects you to pick up a lot via context clues but unless you are familiar with the series and it's methodology it will go over most player's heads (and is still not particularly compelling). Side quests and NPCs are utterly boring. The open world is beautiful at first glance but ultimately feels lifeless and I really didn't have that much fun exploring it. People saying that this is one of the best parts of the game feels nuts to me and makes me question what other open world RPGs they've played (or not full open world RPGs too). AI is actually idiotic most of the time and sneaking is absurdly easy, which is an odd contrast to the difficulty of combat. Menu navigation is absurdly bad. There is no journal. Etc. The whole game lacks any character outside of sheer desolation. If you are into that vibe and the satisfaction of getting through something really hard - great. But that's not the only metric **** and anyone who criticizes these aspects of the game is immediately scoffed at for not understanding Fromsoft games. I suppose you could rate this as a 10/10 if you what you care about is a game reaching the pinnacle of Fromsoft play design. Otherwise, how can a game be a perfect game when it alienates substantial portions of the people who bought the hype of an open-world RPG worked on by RR Martin and got slapped in the face by this game. I played this game for hours and hours hoping that it would grow on me and that maybe if I could just ""git gud"" it would become more fun. But after all that time- I simply can't justify putting any more into it. When I look back at playing this game I can honestly say it just simply wasn't compelling or fun for me. I'm glad all the FromSoft fans are pleased. That's truly awesome. But I feel like anyone considering a purchase needs to understand what it offers- and the many things it doesn't.",5,2022-03-08,PLAYSTATION 5

Salernoaless448,"Elden Ring is the end of a path that from Software Started in 2009. After several years and 6 games of exsperimentations they took the best from each of their previous works and they mixed those characteristics with a beautiful exploration based open world(mainly inspired by Breath of the Wild). The amount of content and its density is great. Every corner of the world (and under-world) map hides a new challenge and a new mystery to resolve. The art direction and lore is brilliant and we have to thank not only H. Miyazaki but also the American writer George R.R. Martin. I also recommend this game to fans of Shadow of the Colossus since in some zones you are going to experience similar feelings. As you can imagine from my previous statements the gameplay is the culmination of souls-like and the definition of a well-made, deep and articulated combat system that barely any videogame has. The game has some clear problems like the recycle of assets and some technical issue but if you overcome this minor issues and let the world of The Lands Between steal your attention you will be rewarded.",10,2022-03-08,PLAYSTATION 5
rocketjohnatar,"Elden Ring is the ultimate gaming experience I have seen for an ARPG. Everybody talked about the greatness of the open world, but the game design completely separates this one from the other open world titles, where it tells the story about the world in a very subtle way. You actually play to see whatever the game tells you, and you will have very different experiences compared other players not because of choosing different dialogue options, but actually exploring the different paths in the game with your varying character. That is why I recommend people who haven't bought this game yet not to check anything about the content of the game from youtube other social media platforms before playing it, for at least 20-30 hours. After that you can somehow sense the patterns in the game, and you can benefit from some information online to make your life easier without spoiling the game for yourself. This is a Dark Souls game, gameplay and objectives wise, as you will be clearing dungeons, killing some very hard bosses and die a lot until you finish the game, with a comparably under-skilled character having the only advantage with i-roll frames. But the caveat here which made me play this game and not finishing the DS games, is you won't be tracing through whole dungeons because your hand slipped in a life saving roll. Most bosses have respawn points nearby and although some may take time, the game progression is not related to most bosses, you can go somewhere else and try it later with better weapons, higher level etc. This removes the wasting time aspect of the game, with adding the feeling of freedom (I cannot emphasize enough) actually makes the perfect DS game. I cannot understand the mindset of review bombers because of graphics. There are a lot of games which does not even have 3D graphics, like Hollow Knight (which I think is strangely similar to this game with the feeling of exploration and challenging bosses), and making it to masterpiece category. I understand the reasoning behind it (outdated textures cannot kill me) but I cannot remember the last time when a game made me say ""wow"" as Elden Ring (I have been playing games for more than 20 years, from every genre). It really made me feel mesmerized, stunned or disgusted (you will know the place when you see it) the moment I stepped into regions, and the bosses of the game are so well designed, I died multiple times while checking some of the details of the bosses' looks. And it can be played on a lot of platforms, mostly well. Frame drops here and there, some freezes occasionally are not much of an issue compared to fun I am having from this game. A 10/10 game does not be a perfect software. It should be a video game where it makes me want to play because of the challenge, because of the situations that it put me in. It should make me both think and feel, and take me to a roller coaster of emotions. This game perfectly does that. I want everybody to have a taste from this game, one way or another, even if you won't play, just check the artwork, it may inspire you on your life somehow. Although I really, really like Elden Ring, there are some people that I cannot recommend to. If you like cars and guns but not dragons, look for something else matches your taste in theme. If you want to see a lot of dialogue, map indicators or cinematic story telling, you may have a bad taste playing this game as it does not tell you much about what is happening verbally, or UI wise. If you are a person who really enjoys having a very fast and acrobatic character with cancellable actions in platformers or other action games, your Elden Ring character will feel clunky and you may not enjoy the action part that much. If you are a person who are on the very casual side of gaming, coming from mobile match-3 titles to AAA games this one may not be for you, at least at first. Other than that, just try this game one way or another, play at your friend's house, rent a PS or just get on Steam then refund it if you don't like it. Just play at least once.",10,2022-03-08,PLAYSTATION 5

I really enjoy doing all of the NPC quests and getting to know them and their back stories. My only gripe is that if you kill maybe a certain boss, or a certain amount of bosses in the open world, it will lock you out of playing co-op with the specific person you've been playing with.. It kind of does ruin the experience a bit.. If they were to change that, I'd give it a 10/10!",8,2022-03-08,PLAYSTATION 5

The counters really don't help later on (I am about 60 hrs in and going slowly and enjoying every minute) The only bad part of this whole release is that I may never go back to DS1,DS2or DS3 and that is a bit sad but this game is honestly all 3 and then some .",10,2022-03-08,PLAYSTATION 5
fishorsomething,"Easily the best game released in the past few years. The open world feels unique, filled with content. Exploration has never been so exciting and rewarding in a videogame before. Unlike previous soulsborne games, Elden Ring encourages the player to try out different playstyles (builds, weapons, equipments, consumables etc). Although at first it seems like the game isn’t beginner friendly, if the player is willing to learn, it quickly becomes obvious that the game is much more forgiving than previous From Software games. Usually there are a lot (sometimes it may even be overwhelming) of paths/choices to take. This means whenever someone is stuck, they can just find something else to do and come back later. The storytelling is not explicit but the lore is huge and really interesting. This makes figuring out the story (through dialogues, item descriptions, environmental storytelling) a unique and great experience. The bosses and enemies are designed very well. Being a from software game, it is obviously not an essy one, but definitely easier than their previous games. All in all it is an amazing game, a really unique and addictive experience.

The reason I've given it a 7/10 is because of the performance issues. Framerate is extremely unstable on the PS5 version and the pop-in is a nightmare. While the game is still playable, it feels extremely unpolished on a technical level and makes me wonder how they thought it was okay to release in this condition. I know many others are having the same issues and if you're wanting more information on what I mean, watch the Digital Foundry video that analyzes the game's performance on consoles. If the game did not have so many technical issues, I'd probably give it a 9/10, but I have to score it based on how it performs now, not how it may perform after 2-3 more patches.",7,2022-03-08,PLAYSTATION 5

Other games feature simplistic combat that is mastered in minutes, they spell out their story so you don't have to pay attention, they give you a big red arrow telling you what to do next.

WildFireX,"9.8/10 Is my actual rating, as there are some slight things that could be improved, & no game is perfect. First of all, the majority of ""0"" ratings are absurd, written by salty Horizon Forbidden West fans that their pandering ""let's just fill the game with anything but white men & make any white men in the game weak or the bad guys"" pathetic excuse for a game isn't getting the shine now that Elden Ring is out. I've also seen too many people giving this game a 0 & then saying ""I've played about 5 hours"" ... Stop it. I won't even talk about people getting their ass kicked & giving the game a 0. This game is a masterpiece, it will win GOTY guaranteed, & it'll be referred to as one of, if not the best game of all time. I've currently played 100+ hours & in the early stages I had more issues with how slow the pace was, but now that I'm far deeper into the game I'm glad nothing was rushed. Elden Ring takes all the best elements of previous titles, & even feels like it takes some inspiration from other games such as Dragons Dogma, & blends them into the most cohesive, massive open world with the richest lore that I've ever played. Just when you think you've seen it all, there's another massive, detailed lore rich area to explore. Boss fights are fantastic, with Radahn being one of my favourite fights so far. They can be absolutely brutal but it only adds to the scale & importance of who they are in the games story. There's a lot of twists & turns in the game, a lot of areas that bring out emotion & depth, & the game is just a true masterpiece once you settle in & really engage with it. The minor gripes I have are that magic is way too overpowered right now, allowing certain scrubs to just flatline most bosses with very little effort, & there's a shortcut to an end game area allowing people to massively overlevel which i hope they cut off. The games story can be a little bit slow, but the benefit of that is you really have to explore everywhere & it gives you time to take more of the game in. Do not take any review seriously that has a 0 & says ""I've played less than 30 hours"" ... Or tries to talk about no quest logs, or other babifying features that we do NOT want in this game. There's a million other games with too much UI, & too much hand holding... There's a reason this game is rated so highly, because it's as pure as a game can get while also being an absolute masterclass in world building.",10,2022-03-08,PLAYSTATION 5

Jake_JJZ,"I have played open world RPGs for over many, many years, and have found that there are two paths that major developers are beginning to take. Either you spam the map full of useless, copy-pasted quests that any monkey can joyfully trot around the map and complete in order to progress some half-assed ""story"", or the developers sink their heart and soul into it. I first thought this when I played some of the Elder Scrolls games, then most recently with Breath of the Wild, and now finally the genre is combined with one of my most beloved franchises, Dark Souls. We see this in it's most grandeur display with Elden Ring. This game has blown me away in every way. All of the greatest, honed combat from a decade of development shows up here in satisfying, beautiful gameplay. All of the crazy world and character design from Miyazaki and his team is still present, and takes lots of elements both from Bloodborne and the Souls games. This is without even mentioning all of the work that George R.R. Martin helped out with, story-wise. You can definitely see elements from A Song of Ice and Fire within many of the quests and stories intertwined in Elden Ring. Overall, the gameplay hooked me, the story held me, and the boss/world design knocked it out of the park.

(Looking at you, Horizon) From Software respects their customers, delivering a complete AAA experience, with no microtransactions, pay to win, skin purchases, or anything of the sort. The price you pay for the game unlocks everything there is, and every player gets the same experience. Having completed the game after investing over 100 hours, I can say that it's easily the deepest, richest, most rewarding open world RPG I've ever played. I rarely replay games, but despite investing over 100 hours, I missed a tonne of content, and multiple endings, so I will be replaying this game. The scenery is beautiful, the bosses are the best FS have ever created, the story deep and fascinating (although not spoon fed, you need to look for it). Are there games out there with better graphics? Yes. Does that ditract from the experience? Not at all. Technically the graphics could be better.

It's about giving that feeling of gratification. But you've gotta have a bit of a stubborn personality to get there. To me, this is the game I've been waiting on my whole life. It's like getting immersed in my favorite book (I like things like Malazan or WoT to get an idea). It's big, it doesn't tell you where to go, there's a ton of story to uncover, lore to learn, places to see, maps to create, and nothing is hand held. If you like that kind of thing, good luck, have fun, die a lot. If you don't, there's lots of games out there that you would enjoy instead that you should put your money towards.

NINAPEDIA,"I never felt the need to write a review on Metacritic before. I was perfectly content watching other opinions roll in and keeping mine to myself. I am a self proclaimed Baby who is Bad at Video Games and I only ever play things on easy mode. I had an interest in other Fromsoft games like Bloodborne and Sekiro but they were way too difficult/intimidating for me. My go to game to hyper fixate on is usually one of the Dragon Age game and I'm so thankful I can play on baby mode and mod it to make it even easier (skip the Fade anyone?). With all this being said, this is the most fun I've had since experiencing DAO for the first time. I wish I could properly explain it but it's really the first open world game that really does feel like an open world. excessive map markers give me Weird Anxiety and whenever a game is pushing me to go one way I always do the opposite because I want to explore. There really is no ""opposite"" in Elden Ring aside from NOT following the Grace Arrows. Whenever I discover a ruin or dungeon I feel wildly giddy because even though there's some topography calling attention to it on the map it really DOES feel like I discovered it because there was nothing telling me to go there. Or merchants!! Riding around and finding a new merchant is something so fun because they really can be tucked away in little place with no indication that they're there. I'm about 50 hours in and still haven't left the first region because I'm still discovering little nooks and crannies I missed. I've never played a game that's made me literally jump off the couch celebrating after I clear a boss on my first try; or makes me THIS TENSE and still somehow turns it into an enjoyable experience. The way combat works has really forced me to slow down and THINK and not just try to over level my guy to an obscene amount.

Forestus,"Let me preface this review by saying I am a souls veteran with over 100 hours of play time so far in Elden Ring, and some of what I will talk about may only become apparent later on for those with less time on their hands. This will contain no specific spoilers, but I will be talking about the general flow of the game and specific mechanics. Elden Rings best period is it’s first 30 hours of play, which in my opinion is why public reception is so good right now. The first two story bosses in that time are great, the exploration is fresh, and you’re basically still learning how to play the game during that time. Martins touch on the lore is very obvious and builds an interesting fantasy world. There are also many improvements to the combat overall in this game. Having a dedicated jump button and jump attacks feel good. Ashes of war are a great concept merging weapon arts and infusions into one elegant and fun system that allow for a lot of build diversity. Certain boss mechanics that people didn’t like from old games have been incorporated in new, better ways that make them not **** as much. Once you’ve explored the first two or three major zones however the game feels stale. The only areas that have that same creative and intricate level design that the souls games had are the major legacy dungeons, and certain entire regions of the world feel mostly empty barring some enemies scattered around. Instead, the game wants you to spend a lot of your time in dungeons grinding optional bosses, runes, and upgrade materials. Elden Ring is not linear and there are dozens if not hundreds of small scale dungeons and caves, but because of that these dungeons are much less interesting than the typical dark souls level. Many dungeon paths are quite literally copied and pasted from other dungeons in the game. They are not the same quality as even minor legacy dungeons, and feel like you’re doing filler content to pad out a zone. In typical souls fashion there are not many quest lines, and for Elden Ring that means simply not enough content to flesh out a world this size. The game knows this and tries to give you extra clues to reach its secret areas but it’s not always enough. Important items that would have been creatively hidden throughout a dark souls level now are spread across these similar dungeons all over the map. items that unlock game defining combat systems are entirely missable. The existence of mounted combat disrupts the combat mechanics you’ve grown to expect of from software in a bad way. Some world bosses are designed around you fighting them on horseback, but certain attacks from these same bosses are also difficult to avoid on horseback without the ability to dodge roll. This leads to a clunky feeling fight where half of it is slowly trying to position your horse the right way so your short weapon can actually reach the enemy, and the other half is you struggling with the menus to resummon your horse when it asks if you want to consume a flask. When you aren’t fighting bosses the mounted combat makes most other enemies extremely easy to deal with. Despite this, crossing large expanses of the rather empty world still feels tedious because there just isn't enough to do and most enemies are pushovers from horseback. There are many games where bosses are hit or miss in the souls series, but at least the vast majority of them are unique and creatively designed. In Elden Ring it’s unbelievably obvious how much more effort was put into main story bosses than dungeon bosses. This is another major part beyond the level design that makes the dungeons feel so boring. As a dark souls player who loves fighting good bosses, this game gives me boss fatigue. You encounter one every 30 minutes of exploration, but the majority of them beyond the first zones are once again, quite literally copied and pasted from previous sections. Great, you killed that boss from that zone 1 dungeon? Now this is zone 3, so here is the same boss but this time it’s two of them. Or now it’s the same boss from before, except he has 1 new move, a new name, and 2x the health. This repetition doesn’t leave much excitement for the boss and just makes it feel like a chore, which is this games single biggest flaw. What are you really exploring if you’re seeing the same things over again? I’m not kidding, of the last approximately 10 named enemies that I have killed, only 2 of them were not reused, and I only found them because I’ve been actively trying my best to follow the few story lines I’m being presented with. Forgettable, easy to kill, and basic sometimes cheesy attack patterns. The only reasons they’re remembered are because you have to fight them so many times. This leads to an experience where the games main content is decent, but the open world which should be the entire selling point of the game feels monotonous, and is its worst quality.",7,2022-03-08,PLAYSTATION 5

Rowd,"Game's amazing, most negative reviews are just from people who like the new horizon game more. Love the kind of story in these games where you have to find it in items and piece it together yourself, it's like the opposite of an exposition dump.

Russellca,Game of the year. Best souls game to date. Hits all the souls elements with voice acting and quests and difficulty is scaled up with open world bosses. People negative reviewing are maidenless and simply not good at games. People complaining about graphics simply need validation on spending their paychecks on a rig that they thought was worth it vs moving out of their parents house.,10,2022-03-08,PLAYSTATION 5
briansb,"Absolutely a genre-defining game. It's sad seeing so much vitriol around the game simply because of its warranted critical success, especially from clear review bombers. I'm not going to discredit any legitimate criticism, but for me this game exemplifies a gaming genre that I find most fulfilling. Full disclosure that I'm only roughly 40 hours into my journey (I say ""only"" because I haven't even gotten to the second legacy dungeon yet), but it's been a glorious journey thus far full of mystery, intrigue and exploration. As a massive fan of Bloodborne, Sekiro and Dark Souls 3, my expectations for this game were sky high and thus far every expectation has been passed. I think one underrated thing (based on some of the review bombing happening here) is that FromSoft excels at art-direction and experiential gameplay. Does this game have the best graphics or fidelity ever? No, of course not. But when we think about video game as a source of art, those are just two criterium in a vast amount of characteristics that make video games special. Elden Ring exemplifies what makes risk-reward balance in gaming so exciting, and how self-direction and exploration give the players freedom to be punished, rewarded and often times a mix of both, rather than being handheld to growth and points of interest. The game's art direction is incredible, giving life and depth to the open world. Additionally, the legacy dungeon I encountered exemplifies the best in FromSoft level design, showcasing intricacy and careful design without bloat nor oversimplification. There are a lot of mechanics that might confuse or bewilder new players. I encourage everyone who is willing to enjoy this game to its full potential to push themselves to learn enemy move sets, try new strategies and embrace the learning experience. You may not enjoy, but in most cases you'll love the FromSoft game paradigm as much as I did and want to play every game from the developer!",10,2022-03-08,PLAYSTATION 5
Night_Terrors,"Felt the need to create an account just to review this amazing game. If you enjoy the souls franchise, you are going to at least enjoy this game, if you enjoy the souls franchise as well as any open world titles, you are going to love this game. Unlike some.... other... open world titles, elden ring is full of so much content that the open world is genuinely justified. You cannot go five minutes of exploration without finding something new. Bosses, dungeons, npcs, etc. Not only that, but everything feels incredibly hand crafted.i haven't encountered a single location that simply feels like filler that was added to make the map larger. The world building is unimaginably deep if you actually manage to follow along, and the combat is impeccable; as you would expect from a souls game. It does enough to feel fresh without changing the formula to an egregious degree. Additionally the art style is breathtaking despite the graphics being somewhat mediocre. Really, everything about this game is fantastic. Mosy of all, it's fun. Which is exactly what a video game should be. With that being said, the game is not without flaw. The biggest issue for me is performance(on a pc port). Now, when I say biggest issue, I do not mean that this is a big issue. Merely that it is the only one noticeable enough for me to mention it. I have a fairly decent setup and I will occasionally see a few frame drops as well as two or three hard crashes in the 70 hours I have played. Is it anything major enough for me to detract any points? Not at all, but if you have a lower end pc, I would perhaps wait for a few patches to drop. Another thing. I view this game as a masterpiece, but you may not. If you do not like the souls franchise, do not buy this game. It is still a souls game at the core and it is unlikely that your view on the game play will change. If you are a newcomer, I would still recommend this game, but I also reccomend that you hesitate. This is not an easy game. It is a fair challenge and you will die. A lot. The greatest part about this game is not the challenge itself, but the feeling of overcoming that challenge.q additionally, the story is not exactly linear. Do not expect red dead redemption style cutscenes. Much of the story must be uncovered by yourself through speaking to easy to miss npcs and keeping a watchful eye to the open world. You may even finish the game with almost no idea of what happened before your character came into existence. If you take these two details into account and neither sounds like a deal breaker, I must HIGHLY reccomend this game. Now. Review over. I am going to play elden ring.",10,2022-03-08,PLAYSTATION 5
Shadygoober,It’s literally the best game I’ve ever played. The combat required skill but the learning curve is not too steep. The map feels densely packed but not with uninteresting pointless things. There’s always something to do and somewhere to go. With already 50 hours in this game I’m no where near completing it. Without the side quests and side dungeons I would say this game takes about 60-70 hours to complete on a first play through however the side quests feel like the meat and potatoes of this game and I often find myself being more interested in them than following the main path.,10,2022-03-08,PLAYSTATION 5

mrode,"I really feel like anyone giving this game less than a 7 has played it for 20 hours or less. Use a few youtube videos to create a decent beginning character and then slog through the beginning just like the beginning of any RPG. But then it opens up. And when I say opens up, I mean that, just by exploring a little bit, I ended up in what looks like a different universe. There is so much to this game. The story is weak, but I feel that exploration is the key. You should be able to wander just about anywhere at any time and feel like you have a shot. If not, mark it and come back later. You are not guided whatsoever by a linear story, so if you're looking for a story driven game, look elsewhere. And if you're looking for next-gen or even current-gen graphics, you're not going to find it here. By why should that be a detriment? Some game choose to 8-bit their games. FROMSOFTWARE chose to say ""Let's tone down the graphics, but make the game HUGE."" ""You mean like this?"" ""No, bigger!"" ""How about this?"" ""BIGGGGGEERRRRR!!!!"" If you're not carefully ransacking a gigantic castle or in the middle of a huge open area with giants all over, then you're in the middle of a field full of life. Little bunnies, big bucks that leave you alone but don't scare too easily. Some goats might take a roll at you or a ram might choose to challenge you. Even the best reviews that the critics gave have a couple serious misgivings about the game, but they still give it a 10. They are correct in doing so. The game is that good.",10,2022-03-08,PLAYSTATION 5

Ziekk,"This is my first Souls game, so I'm not in that hardcore camp. Elden Ring is basically Skyrim's freedom of wandering with an amazing combat system and no hand holding. If lack of a quest journal turns you off, that's okay. It doesn't for me, it makes me feel that everything I do is more immersed in the world. If bosses wrecking you for 2 hours before you squeeze out a win turns you off, that's alright too. I enjoy overcoming that high hurdle, making me feel a sense of pride and accomplishment I haven't had in a game in many years. This may not be for you, but it is for me. From my perspective, this game is a 10/10. I love overcoming obstacles and being treated like an adult. Then again, I played Myst when it came out and the idea of using a notebook doesn't make me furious.",10,2022-03-08,PLAYSTATION 5

Creesy,"I have played the game now for about 30 hours and explored the lands between. I can only say that this game has definitely earned its place in the upper ranks. The map is huge. Especially if you compare it to other Souls games. There is something to explore in every single corner. And some of the coolest items are hidden. Still it is a Souls game and it is hard, especially if you never played one before. I myself havent played a Souls game past the original Dark Souls. Just dipped a bit into Dark Souls 3 on my brothers PC and also played Sekiro. I must say, From Soft really did great job combining all they learned from previous games into this and it is the best version of them all in my opinion. The story is told in the classic Souls way through items and conversations with NPCs. There is a red string you can follow, but its your decision how to follow it. Still, the PC port is not fully optimized and you get a few stutters as well as 60 fps max. That would be a reason for me to only give 8/10 points, but in regards to wht I have read from people giving this game 0 points I think its only fair to pump the score higher.",10,2022-03-08,PLAYSTATION 5
Buffalobriin,"An incredible entry by Fromsoft. This game has a depth, that in today’s current offering of titles simply dwarfs everything. The world is massive, intricate and really pulls off a dark fantasy atmosphere that I didn’t expect. Nearly every feature from all past “Soulsborne” games is implemented and improved. Combat is satisfying, character building is thorough and uniquely diverse. I’m currently over 20 hours in and am still finding new things at every corner. I have no doubt I will be playing this game for years. It’s important to mention to everyone who does not understand this style of game, you do not beat this type of game, you endure. It’s about learning from mistakes, every failure is a learning opportunity. I look forward to learning more with each session.",10,2022-03-08,PLAYSTATION 5

JasonA95,"An absolute masterpiece. It made me fall back in love with gaming. I see a number of negative reviews about outdated graphics & whatnot but honestly it is still a large, beautiful open world with lots of places to explore & loot to be discovered. Some bosses can appear impossible & yes you’ll have to grind your level up to compete with them but that’s all part of the fun. From Software want you to go off and explore to level up so you can find places you’d never previously thought of going. Think I spent the first 15 hours of the game just in Limgrave (the starting area) exploring every nook & cranny. I was simply discovering new locations within Limgrave like; Dungeons, Caves, Points of Interest & new Sites of Grace. This game is all about taking risks to reap the rewards. I won’t put any spoilers as I want players to experience it for themselves but take my word for it when I say it is a work of art. From Software have certainly made the best game I’ve played in many years!",10,2022-03-08,PLAYSTATION 5
prayformojo33,"Lo único bueno es la dirección de arte, el juego en si es súper mediocre, con una dificultad artificial dónde llenarte el escenario con enemigos es sinónimo de difícil, cosa que no pasaba en el dark souls, sekiro o Bloodborne dónde todo estaba perfectamente posicionado para darte una sorpresa o un reto. Sin hablar de los jefes que son la mayoría unos beyblades con patas dado que tu personaje no está equilibrado a la velocidad de ellos. Los npcs están igual de muertos en animaciones como hace 2 generaciones como también tu personaje dónde se ve que reciclaron elementos en el motor gráfico que ya se ve desfasado. El juego no es divertido ni desafiante, simplemente es mediocre. ----------------- The only good thing is the art direction, the game itself is super mediocre, with an artificial difficulty where filling the stage with enemies is synonymous with difficult, something that did not happen in dark souls, sekiro or Bloodborne where everything was perfectly positioned for give you a surprise or a challenge.

digi-,"This game is not a masterpiece this game is not a 10 out of 10. The one thing that this game is definitively is overhyped. I have spent about 60 hrs playing and I will say I have enjoyed **** majority of that time, but there are a lot of glaring issues that are present in Elden Ring. I understand that some people really did not like the linearity of the souls archetype of games, and when meeting a hard boss it was more frustrating than fun to beat your head against the wall until something gave. To circumvent that issue they implemented open world which means you can go somewhere else and come back at any given point in time which is cool on paper! This would be fine IF the world itself didn't feel empty for the most part. Sure you have some cool locations scattered throughout the world that are really awesome experiences, but at some point you forgo exploring for just finding the nearest grace and teleporting around because you instinctively realize that there isn't much to do between point A and B unless you consider collecting another **** time. The biggest problem that I personally have with the game is that the sense of achievement is largely dulled when it comes to defeating a hard boss. You fight so many bosses at every twist and turn and sure some of them are harder than others, but they are so littered throughout every point in the game that eventually it just becomes a slog to get through. You want to get to this checkpoint, well here fight this boss first, you want to get to a new area, Well F you take this boss instead! There's no build up no tension it just becomes routine. When you get to a main area with a main boss thats where the game to me really takes over and shines. In those moments I really found myself having a real joy, but sadly due to open world aspect of the game the developers focused on making the world cohesive instead of the experience of being in the actual main areas itself. Overall it's a good game It has some moments that really make you enjoy it all but sadly mired with a rather mediocre open world and plague of bosses that make you feel more tired than exhilarated once defeating them.",7,2022-03-08,PLAYSTATION 5
TruthOfGaming,"Where do I begin on this title and the insanely inflated hype around it? Elden Ring is yet another entry to the Souls genre, and this time steps away from the tried and true design of tightly crafted game worlds that Fromsoft usually brings us. Unfortunately, we are left with a bland and lifeless Overworld, connected with obscured dungeons that feel copied straight from Bloodborne's Chalice Dungeons. There was something missed in translation here, as most open worlds draw you in with a plethora of things to experience, not just empty space between the next thing to kill. Speaking of killing, the entire game revolves around removing enemies out of your way. This is the same as every Souls game, but this is supposed to be an open world experience. Imagine just laying a linear game out on top of a big map and calling it ""open world"" now. With nothing else to do, you will be traveling across large, empty expanses to find another repetitive dungeon, another rehashed enemy, another reskinned boss...with rewards that do not give you incentive to explore. You hit walls where you cannot pass, so you must go try a different route until you are strong enough to do the ""intended"" route. You will begin to lose steam after the honeymoon phase wears off. The bosses get progressively more ridiculous as you move through the game. Instead of opting for a dance of combat like Bloodborne or Sekiro, you will spend the entire battle rolling around, counting on iframes to help **** you out of a 9-hit combo alive, where each hit of the combo can chunk you for most of your health. Enemies everywhere rely on delay attacks, holding their weapons in the air just until you finish rolling for a cheap kill. Some will defy physics and spin midair to land on you. The whole thing is about being cheesed by enemies or cheesing them by leveling. Even having the strongest physical defense armor in the entire game, plus dumping most of your points into Vigor, you will still be 2 shot by end bosses. Highly disappointing. The ""open world"" is rife with shambling creatures that walk in circles or wait patiently for you to approach and dispatch them. NPC stand around, lifeless in this uninspired world. You cannot track any quests, so unless you have a really good memory, you are expected to play with a journal by your side for notes. The UI used is ugly and over a decade old. Movement is nearly a direct copy from Dark Souls 3, with weapon Arts. The biggest crime here, though, is the reviews from Critics. Unanimously overflowing 10/10 review from nearly every gaming company out there. For a continuation of pretty niche type of game, the how is unreal. Especially when NOTHING here is revolutionary, inventive, or deserving of the word ""masterpiece."" At best it is bait to get people to buy Elden Ring, only to be highly disappointed after the refund return window has closed. Lastly, the hype of George RR Martin to sell the game! This is just using a name to sell your product. You can replace entire words with phrases from Dark Souls. Point of Lost Grace = Bonfire. Watch reviews (not 10/10 ""critic"" reviews, but actual USER reviews), check out some gameplay. Read reddit posts that are not biased towards it being great.

redwinnebago,"Easily the best game I've played in years, and almost certainly the best game that From Software has ever made. Elden Ring is a game that respects the player's intelligence and curiosity. Unlike so many recent open-world games, it won't lead you by the hand and tell you where to go at every turn. You have the freedom to travel to every castle or mountain you see in the distance, and it's up to you to figure out how to get there, and get past any obstacles in your way. There's no easy mode, but there are plenty of tools to make the game easier if you're willing to explore and experiment, and of course you can always practice until you git gud. Parts of it may be frustrating to new players, but the reward is some truly amazing vistas and some of the most amazing boss fights in any game, ever. The world is rich and detailed, and there's tons of lore, but the story is mostly kept in the background to keep the focus on combat and exploration. There aren't hours of drawn-out cutscenes with characters endlessly yapping on. There are characters who you'll meet on your journeys, but almost all of the time you're adventuring on your own, charting your own path forward, with little to guide you except the towering landmarks in the horizon. The combat will feel familiar to Souls veterans, but there are some small additions to the combat to make things a bit more dynamic, like a block counter move that's like an alternate way to parry. Spirit ashes let you summon a wide variety of creatures into boss fights, which can range from mild distractions to truly overpowered beasts. The mounted combat is surprisingly good, and you're even given the option to fight many boss fights either mounted or on foot, and I found myself preferring to fight mounted against many bosses. The main fights are all truly epic, and normal enemy encounters manage to be just as dynamic and challenging. There are downsides to the Souls games going open-world. While the main ""legacy"" dungeons are all amazing, there are smaller optional dungeons tucked away in the form of catacombs, forts, mines and caves. While some of them have interesting level design and bosses, some of them feel phoned-in, a bit like Bloodborne's automatically-generated Chalice Dungeons. There are also repeated overworld mini-boss fights, like the Dragons, Erdwood Tree Avatars, and Night Riders. While they were all engaging boss fights, especially on horseback, fighting 6-7 variations on each with only minor differences does get a bit repetitive, but they're all purely optional. Elden Ring can be an absolutely gorgeous game to look at. The game isn't cutting-edge visually, and in certain places you're reminded that it's still running on some of the same engine FromSoft has used for over a decade, but the beautiful vistas make up for all of it. At it's best the game looks like a concept art painting come to life, and even if every last tooth doesn't have a million polygons, the artistry that goes into the world and character design is as good as anything out there. I recommend playing with HDR if you can (which goes for pretty much all games that support it, but still.) While the game's freedom of exploration is mostly a positive, sometimes it does get a bit too vague for it's own good. The lack of a quest log is usually fine, but can sometimes be a bit frustrating, and you can miss whole questlines if you miss a vague hint or don't stumble on the right shack. It's not a game where you're really intended to experience everything in a single playthrough, but it can still be a bit annoying to miss a whole questline by mistake. As I got further into the game I did find myself looking things up more and more often, which took me out of the game somewhat, although I still prefer it to the game hand-feeding me everything. Even with those flaws, Elden Ring is an incredible experience. At it's best, it really feels like you're a lone explorer a hostile, mysterious world. At it's worst, you're potentially dealing with hours of frustration and yank. But for me, the lows only serve to enhance the highs, and the end result is one of the most engrossing games ever.",10,2022-03-08,PLAYSTATION 5

lowx,"Hay un suceso en la critica de videojuegos sobre el que llevo tiempo pensando, es la maldición del 10, cuando toda la prensa le da un 10 a un videojuego, ¡cuidado! Ojo, no digo que esto sea un caso Cyberpunk ni mucho menos, este es un juego muy disfrutable, sobretodo si eres fan de la conocida saga Souls. Yo lo soy, desde sus inicios, y así como vi la creación de una leyenda del videojuego con unos cimientos mega solidos y una cumbre tan alta como el Everest en Bloodborne y Dark Souls 3, he visto su declive absoluto, acompañado de la misma propaganda periodística que bailó las aguas del declive de Blizzard, en Sekiro y sobretodo en este videojuego. Miyazaki se está quedando sin ideas, y lo peor es que la unica solución que ha encontrado es volver a usar como referencia la saga Zelda, pero con el peor The Legend of Zelda que existe hasta la fecha, el Breath of the wild. Yo aun confio en Miyazaki, y volveré a estar ahí en su próximo videojuego, pero espero que ignore la burbuja mediática que está viviendo y vuelva a su sendero.

Only new mechanic is the **** the year 2022 the new mechanic is the JUMP! Animations are still lacking, hit boxes are still a random joke, it's not AAA, not even close to A.

Do you get an excellent and engaging story? no. unless you have hundreds of free and useless time to read scrolls. Do you get breathtaking and exciting combat? no. all you should do is die too many times just to figure out when and how each enemy attacks, which might be enjoyable for some minority of people, but for most of the people, it just doesn't worth the time and effort. so the only times you really ""enjoy"" playing this game, is when you have defeated a boss or when you enjoy the beauty of the world itself. despite all things mentioned above, I admire their risk in creating an open-world game this wast and adding some features like a horse to the series ...

CrunchyHero,"I feel this game is incredible and an unpolished piece of **** at the same time. Where the game shines, it does so beautifully in its wide range of gameplay styles, exciting boss fights, and well designed main dungeons. The game however is EXTREMELY unpolished. There's an early NPC which sets the entire early game story and direction which you can accidentally miss and have no idea what's going on. At the beginning of the game you're often beating dungeons and collecting items which you have no idea how to use and actually can't make use of yet, making the rewards feel very unfulfilling. There are a bunch of game mechanics that are hidden behind obscure optional texts, or random unmarked NPCs and you don't even get access to the nexus and most of those basic mechanics until like 6 or 7 hours into the game. Over 30 hours into the game, I still don't know how to use some basic mechanics like cooking. Basic things like explaining new game mechanics, quest logs, comparing items to current items in the store, knowing when npcs have new things to say etc. are all missing. Again, these are lacks of basic game polish that deep gamer masochists treat as features, and most people used to modern games will find frustrating. That's not even mentioning the graphics. Which frankly feel like DS1 graphics which can run on a switch, yet this game has random visual bugs and performance issues all over the place on expensive hardware. DO NOT EXPECT A POLISHED GAME. The game also suffers from a complete disconnect in tension. You go from being afraid of most enemies and having to work for everything, to being an untouchable speed demon on a horse a few hours in. Now rather than having to sneak past, or fight enemies in the overworld to access the loot they're guarding, you can just ride around, pick up items with no pickup animation in super overleveled areas and gallop off on your merry way. The horse is OP OP. So much so that there is actually a way to beat a lvl 80 boss, AND get enough exp to get to near lvl 50 as a lvl 1 scrub within an hour of starting the game, all without having to swing your weapon once! Honestly some people might enjoy just riding around aimlessly on an open world copy paste landscape for hours on end on an untouchable horse for variable rewards, but that's just not for me. This game got really fun for me when I stopped treating it like a polished game that I should experience in the way the devs intended, and started treating it like the broken piece of **** it is! I now go online to find the coolest builds, discover how the game mechanics work, figure out the most broken exploits, look up where the most broken items are, and do my upmost to become as much a god yet not too much **** as possible. The game is such that even with the ridiculous exploits, most bosses are still challenging, and you can kind of make the game as hard or as easy as you want by exploiting exp hacks. If you want to grind exp for an hour and become way stronger you can, if you want to spread your points so you can do all the builds yet still be the same combat strength, you can, and if you want to be a deep masochist and wander around for hours finding a few cool things, and grind ****ty mobs and bosses and be frustrated for hours and hours because it hurts so good, you can do that too! This game is beautiful, hideous, amazing, poorly designed, with amazing design choices, with easy ass cheesable bosses, with riveting hard gaming challenges, with absurd exploits, and a lot of frustration and a lot of triumph. So what are you waiting for? This is the best game of the year! It's also the worst game of the year! ... Come check it out!",8,2022-03-07,PLAYSTATION 5

There are lots of weapon types, bosses/enemies, room for exploration of the world and experimentation of your character.

Papizza199,"I'm 50 hours in right now and it feels like the end is still not in sight. Everyone who loved soulsborne will find the culmination of fromsofts experience in their hand. Beautiful and interesting areas, frightening enemy designs and challenging but fair boss fights. But the huge open world design doesnt come without some flaws: Sometimes it is very slow, you really have to commit to exploring, taking your time and be amazed by many hidden areas/dungeons/bosses and loot. Also i got lost a few times, and the game did not gave me very useful orientation where to go to progress in the main quest. And the last problem for me is that for my taste some enemies/bosses got recycles a bit too often. Performance on PS5 is disappointing, 60 fps should be no problem but is rarely the case. But other than that it is really a masterpiece. The build variety, the really precise gameplay ,the tons of content this game has and simply the fun you have while playing it outweigh the problems the game has.

While it is more forgiving than some of FS's previous titles, it's still a ""souls"" game... Be ready to spend hours trying to figure out enemy's movement patterns and die a lot. If this does not sound appealing then again, this game is not for you. What differs it from previous games is the world, which is not only open but manages to avoid the ubisoft formula. There are very few icons on the world map marking locations, and they only pop up once a location is discovered. There is no filler in the shape of find-all-flags or collect-all-logs and so on. There are no objective markers, a journal, quest log, character dossiers, collectibles etc. You are expected to pay attention to what NPC's are asking you to do, often indirectly and often in passing. I found this refreshing, as most games these days seem to be going out of their way to force you to experience everything they have to ofter, and they will remind you of the things you haven't, every time you open a map. When you discover a new location in ER, it's your discovery, rather than an inevitable stop on a theme park ride prepared by the devs. I liked it, would recomend it to a friend.",10,2022-03-07,PLAYSTATION 5

This is work-around-able by having some x-factor such as a ranged attack or summons, but being fair to fist/broken sword only is what made dss, ds1 and ds3 (or even ds2) fun. In Sekiro it only gave you one option, so all bossfights were based around this type of playstyle too. Otherwise, I REALLY like it, but having some bossfights feel to passive or even **** really hurts the enjoyability of Elden Ring as a whole. P.s. I hate that one Godrick attack in phase 2.

erithtotl,"I don't review many games as but given the high profile of this and that I have put over 30 hours in, I wanted to chime in. I've never played a Souls game so this might be useful to someone who is intrigued by the stellar reviews. I have played a ton of open world games. I feel that we have two concepts that don't fully work together. How can you champion exploration and experimentation when a brutal death (often with a steep cost) lies around every corner, many of them unavoidable the first time through? In addition, the combat gameplay doesn't benefit the open world environment. Each enemy has different moves, meaning you can't use your past experiences with other enemies to help you against new ones. Many enemies have unblockable kill moves that until you've experienced them multiple times, you won't be able to avoid. Each foe is starting over, and the only way to learn is to die over and over. It also feels like a single-player MMO. Enemies sit around or follow simple patterns, and respawn constantly. They lack any personality or real interaction. It's super-gamey. The world is super-moody and the boss design and animation is fantastic. But this just isn't the RPG/Open world experience I enjoy.",6,2022-03-07,PLAYSTATION 5

Yeneed,"Just wow. I’ve played the other Soulsbourne game maybe for a total of 5 hours, I just wasn’t really that into them. Elden Ring however, has me completely engrossed. FromSoftware hit a home run with this title. Games have flaws, and by no means is Elden Ring flawless. Those flaws however don’t affect gameplay in the slightest. If you’re able to ignore the **** on social media about this game, and just accept you’re going to die a lot until you figure things out, then this game will blow you away. Graphics may not be the best for a game released in 2022, but I haven’t found a game that just makes me stop everything and just look at the depth, the artwork, the sheer volume of detail put into these landscapes. Mob design is thrilling, I would be hard pressed to find the imagination going into these assets anywhere else. The story leaves a lot to your interpretation near the beginning and quest lines are hard to follow. I kept a notepad and pen with me to keep track of NPCs and locations. I haven’t done that for a game in years and it made me so excited. With that being said some quests left a bit to be desired, but the main story. I found myself wanting to find out more about locations and the main bosses. Gameplay. This is what it comes down to me for games. Bad story? If there’s amazing gameplay I can look past it. **** has the best graphics the gaming industry has ever seen, but terrible gameplay, I won’t even bother. Elden Ring does not have the best graphics, or the best story (not saying either are awful, they are both great), but the gameplay just has you coming back for more. If you’ve died to a boss 20 times, you don’t give up because you think you have just figured out how to deal with his moves. You didn’t, but you try either way. If you get frustrated you can go off and fight smaller mobs and get stronger to meet that boss again. This is one of the best games I have ever played. That’s completely my own opinion, I was extremely happy with my purchase and the replay ability is there. So I will be enjoying this game for the foreseeable future.

Oita75,"Definitely this game show the growing split between press/influencers and the majority of gamers. This is still a hard core game (even if the difficulty was « lowered » with an open world approach) that needs a lot of investment. Finally after 15 hours of game, you manage barely to beat Magrit with the close combat approach. It could be easier to play a magician but I don t like this approach. So you end rolling to avoid aoe strikes, then you strike max 2 times and you do it again and again After that, you keep wandering in a depressive world praying to not lose your runes.. Finally, I think this games could be great if you have a lot of time. For average gamer like me with 5-7 hours a week (this is not negligeable however ), it’s nonsense. Not very rewarding, a bit repetitive, a bit sad.. I wish I would have loved this game but I can t !",9,2022-03-07,PLAYSTATION 5
danathayde,"One of the Best games ever made. Taking inspiration from Zelda Breath of the Wild`s open world, Combining with From Software`s well known formula, Elden ring builds something truly special here. the sense of discovery, exploration and mystery are all there, the whole time. After Zelda, it teaches other open world games, once again, that you don`t need a map full of points of interest, quests and marks. It kills the sense of discovery. Let the player explore. Let the player discover. Let the player struggle. Let the player Thrive on his own.",10,2022-03-07,PLAYSTATION 5

Although its not completely my type of genre and just a handful of few things I couldn’t get warm with, personally seeing the game overall more like a 8.5-9, I‘ll give it a 10 just to counter all those butthurt reviews.",10,2022-03-07,PLAYSTATION 5
trelleus,"Elden ring is a great game I'll start by saying that however it is nowhere near the 10 out of 10 that the soy boy fan boys have the dark soul series tend to give it. If you're looking for an honest review from a person who actually hates dark souls games because of how unrelentingly difficult they are and inaccessible they are to the vast majority of gamers then you've reached the right place. I've put 35 hours of game time into Elden ring and I'm a pretty high level and have beat the 1st 2 major bosses including about 15 or 20 other Mini bosses and I'm here to tell you that Elden ring's overall combat And open world is amazing.. For a new gamer it definitely takes getting used to and you will die but Once you accept that it is a difficult mountain to climb with the satisfaction of standing at the top of the peak at the end of your grueling efforts you'll come to understand the beauty of the soul's franchise. Now I'll get into the major problem for me which keeps this at an 8 instead of the 10 that everyone seems to give it. This game is almost inaccessible for new players, when you're dropped into the world you don't understand anything and no cut scene made me care enough or gave me enough information to truly understand my purpose. I've played the game for 35 plus hours and still I do not understand what it means to be tarnished what the Lands between even are or why I am in pursuit of the Elden ring. The few and far between NP c's that you do meet have 0 lip syncing and are not presented in well choreographed cut scenes and also oftentimes speak gibberish or nonsense that is difficult to understand. On top of that seeing as you don't even have something as basic as a journal to help you you often times get vague representations of Someplace far off in the distance with absolutely no true idea of where to go and because you have no quest book or log or journal of any type oftentimes the side quests that an NPC gives you are so difficult you end up having to go to YouTube instead of truly exploring the open world and finding the quest. Another thing I didn't like was the music you hear essentially the same score of music for your entire playthrough no matter what environment you go to or what part of the map you go to the music is the same thru and thru with the same track on repeat. And even with all of these problems even with the story being essentially an afterthought and and you essentially wandering around during around not knowing what to do I still find myself coming back to play this game hour after hour, Fight after fight, death after death, because the open world is on a skyrim level I'm level of discovery. Around every corner, atop every mountain, across every plane there tends to be something no matter how small worthwhile a much needed item, a new ashes of war, a new spirit summon, or maybe just maybe you get a new weapon. Bosses are so unique and so challenging that regardless of these few flaws I've told you here today which most certainly keep this game away from the fabled 10 out of 10, it is by far a great game worth playing . I know most of this review might have scared you away but I want to be completely honest when I say there are flaws that most newcomers to the dark souls franchise will not like And will not be ready for, but if you can get past that there is so much greatness here And I for one won't be the person to stray you away from such a gem. Elden ring is a great game and is a lot of fun and is worth every penny",8,2022-03-07,PLAYSTATION 5

Adamski_77,This is my first review ever because its the first time in 20 years of gaming i want my money back because the market and the overhyped ratings out there just doesn't fit at all. The game looks and feels really dated. The combat mechanics feels clunky like an early 2000 game. If you are nostalgic and a Souls fan from the beginning this game is for you. If you search for a immersive game experience with a story and modern combat mechanics dont be fooled like me and dont throw your money out of the window. 2 Points for the Boss Design.,2,2022-03-07,PLAYSTATION 5
Grownmangrumble,"I expected this to be great but it surpassed all my expectations. The sense of exploration is unparalleled. The map opens up before you and distant features beckon you onwards. Sneaking throw forests and swamps, scratch plans ara abandoned to the intense curiosity that comes with discovering an unexpected ruin, spectral boatman, cave or castle. Razor-sharp combat mechanics reward perseverance and skill whilst punishing the impulsive with the swift admonishment of death. There is almost too much to do yet still, there are no dull moments.

luc76985,"This is the first time I have felt compelled to review a game on this website specifically because I bought Elden Ring for 2 reasons: I love Fantasy RPGs, and the strength of its reviews. I bought this game upon release and have been playing it almost every day since then. I am an experienced gamer and would rate myself above average in terms of skill level, but I'm no Pro. I work full time and I have a life outside of work. I think I represent your average adult gamer whose free time is limited but still enjoys playing as a hobby. I also passed over two other nearly simultaneous big new releases because I chose this game. Now, all of that being said: think carefully before purchasing this. I think that prior to Elden Ring's release, the difficulty of the game was downplayed specifically so as not to discourage people from buying it. This game will be EXTREMELY CHALLENGING for the casual gamer. Unless you are a gifted gamer, playing Elden Ring will require many, many hours in order to succeed. You may make 99 attempts at a boss before finally getting lucky and succeeding. Or you will spend hour upon hours searching out remote items in order to give you an edge. Often times it will feel like beating your head against a brick wall. Unless you enjoy playing games on the hardest difficulty setting (I don't!) then this game is not for you. And that fact is being obscured by overly-laudatory reviews and condescending fanboys who do not recognize or appreciate the amount of time it takes to make basic progress. An additional deciding factor for me in the purchase of this game was the multiplayer. And let me tell you, multiplayer is a total blunder in Elden Ring. To start with, the process involved in joining your friends is unnecessarily complicated. And then, the game punishes you for playing together! Significantly reduced health potions, totally losing the ability to call your horse, no longer able to summon your pets (spirit wolves/jellyfish/etc), no ability to rest at the ""sites of grace"" to recharge your health/potions, AND THEN. Each and every single time you die, you will be separated from your friends and sent back to your home world to start the convoluted process of cooperating all over again. The multiplayer system is the single biggest fail Elden Ring can make claim to. I legitimately felt bad for convincing a friend to buy this game and play with me upon release, and I will not be recommending it to any others for this reason. Now, after listing my complaints, I should at least, to some degree, acknowledge the game's strengths (although they are surely glorified in great detail by many other reviewers). The game is beautiful. A bit too perpetually dark, but beautiful nonetheless. Truly gorgeous (except all that ugly armor). Second, although it is completely a fantasy RPG, it still manages to be unique and original. This is not a cookie-cutter fantasy game. Character creation is another strength of Elden Ring's. I don't know about you, but I love customizing my characters, and their character customization is A+. Finally, I will admit that the game still manages to be fun. That is, when you're not busy trying to stop yourself from throwing the controller at the TV, or from smashing it on the coffee table, or flipping off the ""YOU DIED"" screen for the ten thousandth time. It is fun, but it is tiring and frustrating to a degree that potential buyers need to be aware of - a fact that I think was intentionally obscured by pre-release reviews, and is condescendingly dismissed by the ""get good"" groupies who, quite simply, have more free time than you probably do.",5,2022-03-07,PLAYSTATION 5

The crystal cave part with the centipede guys just spam the needles and can also attack at the same time. Also Raya Lucaria academy is lame. All the enemies will spam spells at you making it not fun after a while. Also it is not clear where to go and I ended up spending a long time to find and item instead of progress.

Vahradrim,"FOR THOSE WHO DON'T LIKE ELDEN RING: It is normal to hate this type of game at first. If you give it you challenge yourself to finish this game no matter what (even watch a video of it to help). And if you do, at 10% of the adventure you will love it so much, it will be hard to like any other game. It did that to the rest of us. The video game is a masterpiece for so many players, is the game bad and we're blindfolded, or did you miss something? Instead of a review with points that you can find anywhere, I will give my feeling about this new FromSoftware: Amazing graphics, let's be honest, it is breathtaking. And I'm not talking about the definition of textures because you can find better textures in other games nowadays. The world they've created is literally stunning! The topography gives a lot of verticality to the game and you find yourself wanting to go to a place just because you can see a crazy looking castle or tree from afar. Animations, particules, shadows, wind in nature, enemies, there is so much to see. The gameplay itself is so flowless, switch from one weapon to another, invoking spirits, the hit/parry is brilliant. However the camera can be finicky sometimes, as well as the ""lock enemies"" that can sometimes lock an enemy far away while you wanted the one that is in front of you (happens sometimes but it can be anoying to die for that). The game alternate extremely well between outside environment and dungeons, forcing you to diversify your way of playing. The loot is great, just great. They found the right dose of rare equipment (it's not a Diablo III) and being able to find some randomly or by exploring. The rewards at the end of big side quests are crazy but of course require stats you can't afford yet and that's excellent because that let you enjoy the ones you have right now but still looking forward to it. The beginning story is good for now but hard to follow, there's so many names. Sekiro had an easier story to follow, so it feels like a downgrade to me here, but I'm not far into the story yet to judge. Overall an amazing game that I will discover for the next years to come.

Damian-Koolray,"as close to perfection as a video game or any other media gets for me Elden ring is a masterpiece in its combat, storytelling, (open) world design, and music the combat is simple yet the actions of the enemies makes ever single desicion in combat important, do you strike now or bait out their attack first so you dont take the risk of trading damage? do you heal now or maybe wait one more hit so you dont waste your limited healing recourses? every moment in combat has a desicion to be made and that makes the combat never boring because you are always on high alrets on what your next move should be. there is also a massive amount of options to consider when partaking in combat what kind of weapon will you use, a greatsword with amazing range or perhaps a kitana smaller but faster and easier to evade with how much armor will you wear, will you put a lot of heavy armor taking less damage however being more difficult to dodge with? perhaps your feeling like long range options, a bow or crossbow function diverently and and multiple way of attack and arrow types which are all useful. magic more your thing? have 2 different version in sorcery's and incantations both of which have powerfull offensive abilities and more passive supporting and defensive abilities you options in this game are insane and all of them are viable and i haven't even covered all of it like the ashes of war which can completely change how you use a weapon. The main story of elden ring is a simple but effective one its when you start reading the descriptions of the items, armor's and weapons you collect and look closely at the world around you is when the smaller details of the story are shown and the fact you can get the basic premise of the story if you wish or delve more deep into the story to uncover what trully happened is amazing. this game has the best open world out of any video game i have ever played the previously mentioned storytelling is one of many reason but there is so much more open world games have for a long time carried the stigma of them being empty or having nothing to do expect reach missions elden ring has a massive world to uncover and thankfully it is never boring or not helpful you will always find something that will help you in your future journeys like new weapons, armors or ashes of war which massively shake up the gameplay. these are also very well placed and spaced, there is no place or area in elden ring that does not hold something either interesting or helpful it perfectly filled with goodies to collect and enemies to conquer the graphics may indeed not be the greatest on the market however that was never the intention of the developers of elden ring (FromSoftware) they let the beautifull design and amzing art direction carry their games and elden ring has both in spades. no 2 area's looks alike and all of it feel like a different world to explore a lot of this games design ties back to the storytelling and the world crafted within its story is beautifully crafted what a lot of people consider a negative in this game is it's difficulty but this is no random occurrence by poor design FromSoft has stated multiple times they aim to create hard games and they want their players to overcome the challenges set before them the difficulty in elden ring is perfectly crafted (for the most part) all enemies have a wind up to their attacks that shows when, how and where to dodge THIS is video game difficulty done right there is no cheap enemy that ignores the rules of the game to cheapshot you, there is not isntant kill attack that you cannot avoid. by using death as a learning tool the player will slowly learn how to properly evade and conquer the enemies before them, as long as they never give up. it's not a matter of live and death, its about what breaks first. your will or the barries in your way the one objective problem this game does face (at the moment of writing this review) is the frame rate problems this game is stuck at a capped 60FPS and will sometimes dip to 45 for a second this happens maybe once every 20 to 30 minutes this isn't a massive problem (not to me at the very least) however it is still a problem that needs fixing FromSoftware is steadily pushing out more updates to help out this problem which hopefully shouldn't exist in the near future. and to the person considering buying this game, please read both sides of the reviews and see which side is clearly trying to review bomb this game over things it was never meant to be or has no control over and look at the side giving detail on why this game succeeds in what it sets out to do. miyazaki and the entire fromsoft team has trully outdone themselves here, for any fan of their work or newcomer this is their masterpiece and i cannot reccomend it enough. all in all elden ring is a beautiful, intense, expansive and immersive masterpiece that i implore any fan of video games to try out",10,2022-03-07,PLAYSTATION 5

I think I might have played Dark Souls 1 when it FIRST came out for like two hours before quitting and never picking it up again (I say this just to show my lack of any experience with FromSoft games) but Elden Ring has completely immersed me in a way few games are able to do anymore. I used to LOVE open world games, but the last few years they’ve become a chore to get through, I’m not invested in the story, and it’s just endless fetch quests. Elden Ring has completely reinvigorated my love for open world games and what they can accomplish. This game is HARD- like I died at least 80-100 times on one boss. But, it rewards perfecting a strategy and learning how each boss moves and when you finally do win in a hard fought battle, the satisfaction and happiness lasts long afterwards because you know you didn’t just have to button mash to get the win. I think I played a full 16 hours yesterday and didn’t want to put it down but needed to sleep. I woke up and immediately couldn’t wait to start playing again. If you want a real challenge and the immense satisfaction of overcoming some of the hardest boss fights I’ve ever faced in gaming, I highly recommend this game. I think after I play through a new game plus I’ll try the other FromSoft games",10,2022-03-07,PLAYSTATION 5
Yaozza,"So I have had a colossal amount of fun with this game and went on here to read what others are saying and boy was I surprised, until I read the reviews. They have fundamentally misunderstood what this game is, and isn't. And some complaints are just petty. Most of the negative reviews seem to not understand the well established formula that FromSoftware games have had for 15 years. Why would they change it now? No the game doesn't have a quest-log. For me this adds to the immersion and my curiosity. How do I reach that tower? Where did that NPC say he was going next? This is also a formula that FromSoftware has worked with since Demon's souls and harkens back to RPG:s and adventure games from the 1990:s so I don't understand the outrage. The game can be hard, yes, but why should all games be for all people? I don't particularly like Naughty dogs games but if you do then more power to you. I'm not gonna write a review on Uncharted saying I wish it had enormous swords instead of guns and rate it 0. That would be dumb. I understand that those games are not for me. There most certainly is a story. Again, this storytelling technique might not be for everyone but it has worked for FromSoftware for a long time and I for one quite like it. Why do people think they would then release a linear cinematic experience when that is not the kind of game they make. This honestly baffles me. This is already my favorite game of the last few years and on my top ten. And I'm not even close to done with it. There's so much to explore, bosses to kill and upgrades to get. It has given me a sense of childlike wonder like no other game has for ages. It does have some performance issues but I haven't encountered any game breaking or lasting issues on PS5. I'm also sure that the frame rate issues are gonna get patched out in a matter of weeks. This game is huge and is getting bigger with every stone I turn. I accidentally found a huge hidden city with two boss fights in it. I was in that moment awestruck by the sheer scale of this game. In my opinion, if you like RPG/adventure games and is OK with dying as a game mechanic, this game is a must play and for me the experience is a 10/10. Sorry for the long post.

gabu840,"The game is good but not to the extent the reviews have shown it to be. The Game starts great but gets dragged on after say 15-20 hours . Many of the bosses are repetitive & recycled (esp. later in the game) & are cheap in the sense that they are quite easy. A fun gameplay is the one where you have to work out to come against challenges but here if you are just a bit smart enough you will be moving like an OP player most of the time taking away all the fun of the game itself. It has a tedium quest system i.e. you need to explore open world to defeat story bosses . This is a very old structure & many a times it has been been criticized & condemned as poor game structure but none of the reviewers is pointing it here ..why because its a souls game. The game is saved by its art direction, it is praise-worthy otherwise the Graphics are poor, many parts it is generic & shows no work is done on the graphical department just used the Graphic editor output as it is, overall quite poor it is in parts. NPCs & story is actually forgotten . We are still not over with it. The Icing on the cake is the performance , it not only stutters at 4K but also at 1080p(on a 2080ti), Damn what these reviewers are doing ?? that being not pointed out by reviewers is just bad, totally bad ..Are they paid?? It just lacks polishing compared to other titles. What’s bad and lazy in the game is just plain bad and lazy. I believe that developers got this advantage that it is a souls game so even small or big things like camera issues etc are planned in the game intentionally . Overall the game is quite overhyped with all those giving it a 10 have never played a good open world before or either new to gaming or have just gone with the trend of high rating it. Be careful. Its a game which one should try out after the game is around or below 20$ . Its nothing close to Bloodborne or Sekiro. Gave it a 6/10 because of its performance issues otherwise its a solid 8/10 . Graphics - 2.5/5 Art Direction - 4.5/5 Story/NPCs - 2/5 Gameplay - 4/5 (not counting the recycled & repetitive stuff) Discovery & Adventure feel - 3.5/5(your mileage will vary) Sound - 4/5 Music - 3/5 Open-World - 3.5/5",6,2022-03-06,PLAYSTATION 5
GeaKay,"This is one amazing game. I had to request a refund on PC and buy it for PS since the PC port was horrible. The game would not even start. However, now I'm playing it on PS and I am enjoying it so much. The design, game play, lore, and the secrets and the scenery are simply impressing. By the way, there is no ""surprise mechanics"" in this game, so Dice, EA and many others should start taking notes! The inventory system needs some updates, the community of Elden Ring is strong and very helpful, and this is definitely not a game you want to rush. Take your sweet time because you are not competing with streamers, enjoy it at your own pace. Good luck and have fun.",9,2022-03-06,PLAYSTATION 5

If you play the game like a normal Dark Souls game where you follow a linear path, you'll end having the worst time of your life with this game. There are certain dungeons that I have skipped entirely because of the frustration they cause even after levelling up (mostly due to other than combat-related mechanics), and the rewards you get from finishing dungeons in general often end up being very disappointing, but I would still say that it's a worthy addition to the Soulslike genre. I also tried multiplayer for the first time ever (coop only), and offering a helping hand feels very satisfying.",8,2022-03-06,PLAYSTATION 5

Belchh,"This the perfect version of Dark Souls as far as gameplay is concerned. Lots of systems that didn’t quite work in the previous games now make perfect sense. Exploration is continually rewarded. Boss fights are challenging and just like people wanted them to be. The problem is really me, I’m not most people. In fact, I’m downright weird. Which in this case means I actually played these torturous games – Demon’s Souls, Dark Souls, Bloodborne, and Sekiro – not for the challenge, but for their worldbuilding, their characters, in short, the stories they had to tell. Don’t get me wrong. All of that is still there. But it’s buried underneath dozens of hours of exploration and venturing into mini-dungeons. These are, in theory, well-designed. After all, all of them are handcrafted. They aren’t procedurally generated Chalice Dungeons like in Bloodborne. Some of them even have lore significance. But most of them have very little in the way of that upon closer examination. Oh, you’ll be amply rewarded for going in and clearing out the baddies. This is not like Breath of the Wild where you get the same orb 100 times. But see, I’m just not the type of person who cares. And that’s where my issue is with this game. Exploring the open world is required so you can level up and defeat the real bosses of the main quest. I’d rather not. The ratio of “just another item I won’t use because I already got the Heater Shield and Longsword at the start” to discovery of important locations and encounters with actually interesting characters is about 5:1, being very generous. Note that I did not finish this game, and I think that that’s unreasonable to expect of a single human being. But I did put 40 hours into it and reached the capital, thoroughly underleveled. I’m dropping it now, even though it hurts to never see the development of all these characters go anywhere. I know that for lots of people, this’ll be a 10/10 experience. Just not for freaks like me, sorry to say. And as you’re probably also one of those, don’t buy this game. It’s not worth it for you. And I know I’m talking to one of you because you actually read my entire thing. Toodles.",7,2022-03-06,PLAYSTATION 5
themostunclean,"First off, I can call myself a Soulsborne veteran at this point. After Bloodborne I went back and played every game since Demon’s Souls and even recently completed the remake. But the formula is getting boring and Elden Ring does literally nothing new outside of being set in a directionless open world. The move to an open world also destroyed everything that was actually fun about the earlier games. Secret shortcuts- almost none. Great rewards for defeating bosses you spent hours defeating- nope but hope you like getting a bunch of useless crafting materials or NOTHING AT ALL. The reviewers major outlets chose are mostly Fromsoft veteran fanboys who believe every Souls game is a masterpiece. If you’re a veteran like me and felt the games were getting a bit stale DO NOT BELIEVE the 97 score.

If your looking for an easy ride it’s maybe best to replay ratchet and clank. The graphics for this game are phenomenal, anyone saying otherwise clearly fails to recognise the art style, combined with the sheer size, details and depth of the world available to explore in Elden ring. As of writing this review I am roughly 20 hours in, and will update as I finish in what could easily be a 60+ Hour play through. My only complaint would be the story, which has so far left a bit to be desired.

CuttlefishJones,"Never played a souls game. Watched lots of people screaming in frustration whilst they played them and thought that's not for me. Saw the promise that Elden Ring would be a more approachable game, designed for regular gamers to get into. Turned out that was a big fat lie. It's no more approachable than any From software experience. The world is, ironically, pretty souless and a drab sepia colour. Every enemy is overpowered, the hit boxes, lag, and aiming are in dire need of fixing, leveling up is obtuse and painfully slow, and the general gameplay was the pinnacle sometime in the 90's. You can jump though, so that's novel. From software seem to have missed the point that games are supposed to be fun, they should really take some notes from more sophisticated games like The Witcher or Cyberpunk, Elex etc It's a game built to frustrate, one that punishes you if you attempt to wring any enjoyment out of the world they have built. If you have a masochistic streak, enjoy games that lack any sophistaction, or just harken back to the gaming era when games were hard because that was the limitation of the hardware then this is for you. Otherwise hang on to your cash, there will be much better games to spend it on soon.",1,2022-03-06,PLAYSTATION 5

wvs94807,"I am well aware of other people's gripes with the game, I am not massive souls fan but I have played each of them and quite enjoyed them. I agree with others reviews that the games reuses models, even from Dark Souls 3, that there are pop ins when you load into an area. However the main complaints seems to be that people don't know how to play a game that doesn't hold your hand. People who expect to be guided like a baby and told what to you, this is not the game for you. Everything is about exploration and beating a challenge, or learning when to move on and return later. It is true that there are NPC quests but the game doesn't mark it on the map. The NPCs will tell you or hint at what you have to do and its is up to you to figure it our or stumble on the location like I have most of the time. I don't really care about graphics, but the game is very beautiful. Is it Horizon levels of gorgeous, of course not, this is a game where gameplay seems to be the main focus and graphics second. Which is fine by me, as no matter how gorgeous a game may look if it **** ass I will get bored quick. As far as gameplay is concerned, its very FromSoft. You can be a giant hammer wielding sorcerer, or a shield only lightning faith build, or a dual wielding katana, one dealing bleeding damage and another poison, a fire wielding double lance user who throws holy dame when two handing. There are many ways to play the game and yes unlike other soul games, you can respec. Don't let salty reviewers who don't know how to read or have no patience tell you what to do or think, but do keep this in mind. If you have no patience and don't like dying over and over, need to told what to do to enjoy a game then this is definitely not for you. Regarding story, it is fine. Its not as hidden or confusing as in Dark Souls or Bloodborne. I understood the overall plot, the smaller details I will learn through VaatiVidya, as will most likely all of use giving a high score, like I said above FromSoftware games aren't loved by their story but its gameplay. If there is one issue I do have with the game, is the NPC quest component. Unlike previous games this world is huge, having at least a journal in game with the last conversation has with each NPC would be good enough for me. On the other hand, I'm going old school keeping a journal myself with areas and NPC met, its pretty fun and I've never been much of a notetaker.",9,2022-03-06,PLAYSTATION 5
Tharxian,"An absolutely master piece! The very game that kills any soul-like game existing, even those by From Software. When the whole industry is trying replicate the success of Dark Soul series, Hidetaka Miyazaki just show us the ultimate version of soul game. yyds!",10,2022-03-06,PLAYSTATION 5
aligalahan,"I own both PC and PS5 versions of the game. For PS5 version i will ignore the technical aspects. To call this game Open World RPG will be huge misleading the gamers. It is not a story driven RPG. The ""world"" is not lived in. It is not a meaningful representation of any world setting. Best way to explain what it is a Lovecraftian nightmarish realm with bosses and monsters spread around the map. Only meaningful anchors for a human players are the occasional NPCs that are as vendors. They are incredibly out of place, literally and figuratively. So this cannot be the best Open World RPG game ever, since it is neither a open world nor an RPG game. It is a soul game takes place on a open area/field. It is more like a monster fighting arena game with skill progression. It is not something you can compare to Witcher3 or Skyrim etc. Let's get that part straight first since professional media is misleading players who are not familiar with Soul games. Defining characteristic of a Soul game is ""extremely hard"" boss fights. And not its story. Not so surprisingly that is also the case here. There is no meaningful story here, there are tons of obscure and non sensical narrative. Part Japanese translation, part source material. Whatever GRR martin has written (if any), clearly developer just tromped on it and what is left is nonsensical garbage. You will enjoy this game, if primary reason you play the games is challenge and skill progression. The game is closer to MMOs than single player open world RPGs. You need to farm a lot in this game to give your character a chance to kill next required boss. It has even same MMO raid zoning type setups in the game. Now i know i sound negative. But in reality game is an addictive and good game. It is more like 7 or 8 out of 10. That is if you like the unique genre this game is. Yes there is something like that. It is called ""Soul like"" games. You die hundreds of times and build the skillset to kill impossibly difficult nightmarish next boss. Graphics of the game is closer to Oblivion than Skyrim, much worse than Witcher3, or Red Dead Redemption. It runs on old engine. Developer tried to compensate this by adding ""Silmarillion"" style majestic light trees, and that is creating an illusion of fantastic setting. graphics are poor. But artistic style is good, with what is available to them developers created an interesting world. I wish they actually put some stories in there to explain the lore behind it. Overall it is the best Souls game. but it is no way the best open world RPG where all reviewers are lying about. Be aware before buying. Especially the ones that are not familiar with this genre. So how did this game got the 10/10 scores from all professional reviewers. It looks like there is a simple answer. Because unlike other games, only the ""soul fanatics"" reviewed this game. Why is that? Because game is so so difficult to play and beat in the given time frame for a preview of 1 week, for most media sites, only the Fans of the Soul like games have committed to the review, and result is magnum opus rating, for a not so magnum opus product. Now that said, i started to enjoy more and more as i play the game. It is extremely addictive and exploration and character progression aspects are well done. So i am altering my score to 6. I think if you are not uber fan of souls genre, this is more reasonable rating. Ultimately IMO Elden ring is not an RPG game, it is an Arcade game with similarities to modern MMOs than popular open world RPGs. Its biggest flaw in my mind it does not have a cohesive story, you can finish this entire game and you wouldnt know what the heck it was about. Every human you encounter in this world, save few NPCs are hostile against you. By definition the world is not immersive, it is an arcade battleground with focus on combat and killing bosses.

Rainbow_Lotus,"This is my biggest video-game-disapointment ever. A dark souls game of extreme quality, that has been opened for the casual gamer. That was my expectation. Now, 30 hours of later, im deinstalling, and am not going to ever play this, nor buy any From Software game ever again... Honestly: I regret the 30 hours of frustration i had, and the hilarious amount i paid for it. It basically is just a fighting simulator. There is nothing more in this game. Run around, fight difficult to impossible (for me) battles, grind endlessly, progress extremely slowly, and, from time to time, discover items that may or may not be useful for you. You will die a lot, lose all character progress regulairly, and generally, have no idea what this game is actually about. The story is non-existent, the world is extremely lifeless, and just filled with enemies that wait only or you, and the storyline will come to an end pretty fast, because you will just not be able to beat the bosses. At least, if you are a casual gamer iike me. Which forces you to battle easy opponents forever, as rewards and character developement are hardly more than a cosmetic feature. Of course there are ways to exploit the game, but as soon as i need youtube in a tab to achieve any chance of progression, a game has failed for me. My last experience in this game, after exploring the whole starting region desperately, was a sorceress who finally enabled me to learn new spells. Which gave me hope, that the torture had come to an end. And guess what: Those spells are far weaker than the weak ones, that you start with. Its a slap in the face, and im sure, that its an intended one. This is Elden Ring in a nutshell...",5,2022-03-06,PLAYSTATION 5

bebopi,"Elden Ring despite what I was hoping didn't do anything new to the FromSoft formula, besides add an open world. Alone that wouldn't warrant a negative review, but the combat gets clunkier and clunkier each new game as the bosses get faster and faster. It felt mandatory for each boss to have an AOE attack, a ranged attack, and some type of drawn out combo that afterwards gives you about two hits of room before it's back to unrelenting dodging. Exploring the open world was my favorite aspect of the game. It was fun getting sidetracked trying to get better gear or advance an NPCs quest. But after that it was back to running headfirst into mandatory bosses that are just way, way to fast for the combat. It felt like after Bloodborne Fromsoft wanted to move in a direction of more constant and relentless combat, but haven't found, atleast to me, an enjoyable balance between player and boss. It's not a bad game, it's just one that I feel falls very short of its predecessors, doesn't expand on the combat system that's becoming rapidly dated with new boss designs. The story is the same as other fromsoftware games but a new setting. Insert fantasy land, insert event that breaks it apart, mandatory magic/religious/intellectual institute. It's not bad, it's just not new. But the real story comes from the characters and there quests, which are on par with other Fromsoft games. After six previous games of the same story telling formula I would have liked to see a bit more direction with NPC quests, especially in an open world game, as when an NPC tells you to go meet this other person but without any direction it can become very tedious trying to track them down. Most people likely just went to a wiki or guide, and I can't blame them. Overall if you're a returning Fromsoft fan they're is a good chance you'll enjoy it, but don't hold your hopes to high about sizable change in the formula, and if you had issues with it before they're going to come back here.",4,2022-03-06,PLAYSTATION 5
Hoob,"Absolutly awesome. That's how an open world should be like. It's certainly a mix of BotW and Dark Souls. The horse combat is fantastic and well incorporated in the fighting. Couldn't recommend it more. I play on XSX and there are no issues at all. A bit of balancing needs to be done probably, spells seem so much better than incantations, but that's a minor issue.",10,2022-03-06,PLAYSTATION 5

I have fallen to reviewers, not halted much by company’s PR team, talking how this title is a great entry point even for newbies. It really isn’t. Biomes look fun, graphics are OK and items do have nice soul/climate behind them. That’s why 2/10. Can’t add points for monsters: their concepts is cool but physics and animation break immersion really bad. Everything else is still too difficult for me to enjoy. I have just spend £50 on game that’s I’m physically unable to play due to my reflexes not being enough. Feeling totally scammed. And obviously there’s no way to return it. I had few other disappointments in last 2 years and I think it’s about time I stopped buying games. Either you give me a free demo or you’re in a subscription service - just say no to buying games.

Syl20,"I have a love/hate relation with the soul series and Elden Ring is no different! It does improves on the « Pros » with the open world and amazing environment and ennemy design but the same old « Cons » remain! The game will hammer you with tons of very cheap deaths. Deaths you suffer from bad gameplay where you feel the « game » got you killed, not the ennemy. I died hundreds if not a Thousand times because of camera twists and turns that got me totally lost and stuck and unable to dodge or jumping off a cliff trying to. They often make you face big guys in narrow corridors/hallway where half of your weapon swings are gonna end up « pinging » against a wall/doorway while the ennemy attacks will pass right through them. Diying 10 minutes after last « grace/bonfire » in such a cheap way is beyond frustrating. Having to run back and re-do all the fights you had a hard time to reach your runes only to die again in a cheap manner makes you wanna rage quit every time. It’s sad cause the rest of the game is amazing! Graphics/sound/class/skills/spells/etc everything is 10/10.

YunusEdros,Elden ring is a great game with amazing exploration and it was overall a good experience. There was lot of times where the boss AI would break and freeze or just stop attacking etc which was a bit odd and the only reason I am giving a 7 and not a 8 is because of some game breaking bugs which made me go back many hours on a 50 hour save file because of a soft lock bug which was known throughout the community.

Scave,"Hugely overrated game. It looks beautiful, and is definitely enjoyable, but has nothing that's actually new. The usual dodge/parry/counter combat we've seen a million times before but this time in an empty open world. No story, very little character interaction, and almost no dialogue. It does seem that souls-like games tend to get over-exaggerated scores because gamers think they need to be taken more seriously 'coz hardc0re'",5,2022-03-06,PLAYSTATION 5
Pablo_9648,"Definetly the worst game from the soul series, as it even gets to be called a ""soul series game"" even though it pretends (or was marketed pretending to) be something new and different. It is not. The game is a poor mixture of Dark Souls 3, Bloodborne and Sekiro. It's absolutely generic, as it copies infinite secondary and mini-bosses from the previous games. The game is an eternal liop in a poor open word, boring and repetitive, with no plot (contrary to what was sold, using the name of George R. R. Martin). After all that, graphics were far better on Demon Souls. Even still, the game struggles to load scenarios, hardly runs smooth on 60 fps using the performance mode and has a lot of issues. For example, I had one boss, wich was so generic I can't remind his name, being sanding still at his final 10% of life waiting for me to put him out of misery (wich was probably being a part of this game). Never seen such an overrated game. I only recomend it if you are in for some dark souls copied gameplay, wich may be fun. Don't expect more than that.",5,2022-03-06,PLAYSTATION 5

Not only are there sensible checkpoints in this game but thanks to the open world design, you can mostly run past difficulty spike foes and come back for them when you've levelled up. A few of my Soulsborne gripes are withstanding... You still need to grind/farm to level up and you need to rely heavily on Google/YouTube to figure out how to do stuff, so I've knocked a couple of points off for those irks.",8,2022-03-06,PLAYSTATION 5

Bosses are too fast spamming aoe, spam ultimate oneshot moves, tank insane amount of damage and more. Either have a slow, tanky and hard hitting enemy, a fast low health hard hitting enemy or a fast, high health but low hitting enemy, that is balanced not what elden ring does here I have beaten malekith last i played, tried malenia and am now am at a point where i lost all interest, not even planning on making a new character playthrough with a different build as i would normally do. Lazy, cheap and overtuned design, recycled music themes and bosses and more. This game falls under the same trope of being overhyped but not satisfying. Too bad that other reviewer are biased and scared of the community as of past embarrassments and falsy give this game top notch reviews despite major and obvious flaws. If you played other fromsoft titles and expect a good time, forget it until some patches come out, you wont find what you are looking for despite performance issues that might get fixed. dissapointment can't even describe what i feel on this game .",3,2022-03-05,PLAYSTATION 5

NOTORIOUSN8,"+10 pts for the art and design. -3 pts for the mechanics being all over the board. -2 pts for terrible PC port -2 pts for bad multiplayer setup -1 pts excluding players just because they're not good at the game and you don't want to add a lower difficulty. I will say, the world building is amazing and crazy how much there is going in it. The art looks amazing and one of the best looking games I've seen. So artists for the game should feel proud. Beyond that the game just **** and people really think it's amazing only because they are so distracted by pretty graphics they ignore poorly balancing and bugs. Sadly the game when working perfect isn't even that horribly difficult. The majority of the times I've lost to a boss and I didn't dodge the wrong way or something is because they glitch out. This goes both ways to, some are to easy because of the bugs. One of the first little dungeons I went in the boss wouldn't even move no matter how many times I reset it so had to just kill it and move on without even fighting it. Today trying the first big story boss and his dragon arm grabbed me multiple times when I wasn't even by him. He picked me up but I was floating in the air over 10 feet from him and killed me. Of course the game is hard when bosses don't work right. The bosses that don't bug out are usually a challenge but most of the time I win after only a few try's at most. As far as difficulty goes, it just pisses me off when my girlfriend would love to play the game and see the world they crated and enjoy the story. But she can't because they think only elite gamers should be allowed to play it. She just isn't that good at this kind of game no matter how hard she try's and can never play the game because of that. I'm sorry, but to me that's just being a bunch of stuck up **** who think to highly of themselves. Plus, any dev launching a game on PC with that many bugs doesn't deserver any praise.",2,2022-03-05,PLAYSTATION 5

The world they have created is colossal, absolutely oozing with content and secrets to uncover - and what makes this experience so great is that you’re free to uncover it all in whatever way you please. There are no rules, only tidbits of information and guidance to help you along your way. This is an absolute must play, a genre defining piece of work and Miyazaki & the team at FromSoft should be immensely proud of what they have achieved here.

It feels like a step back from the progress sekiro and Bloodbourne made. The open world is bland, empty and boring. Finding reasons to continue playing the game gets more and more difficult as time goes on. It is nowhere near FromSofts best entry, arguable being their worst. It feels like open world dark souls 1.

Unlike other games which aim to give you a false sense of accomplishment by offering an illusion of a challenge, this game offers you the chance to earn a sense of accomplishment. The sense of danger makes the stakes feel higher. When I defeat a boss or open a chest I am eager to see if I will get something that will help me to better survive in this place.

Graphically the game looks great on PS5 particularly if you like Dark gritty games. The battle system is hack and slash with dodge rolls and timed dodges. If you are bad at dodging plan to die alot. If you aren't good at games like dark souls then you probably will die quite often. It feels like a darker version of Zelda Breath of the wild mixed with Dark **** game has quite a bit of customization and you get to design character at the beginning. It is essentially a more advanced dark souls 3. If you're looking for a challenge this game has plenty maybe even enough to make you rage quit.",8,2022-03-05,PLAYSTATION 5
Zanfers,"I am by no means a Soulsborne veteran. I mean I olayed several of the FS games but I am not a pro or someone who gets REALLY deeply into them. That being said, for a casual gamer this FS game is the nost fun and accessible. It is still challenging, but I really enjoy that if something is way too hard at the moment, you can just do something else. This way the game is far less frustrating and repetitive. Exploration is rewarding, this is the first FS game shere I really discover every nook and cranny of fhe map. One thing I still cannot get used to is the style of storytelling. Especially in the terms of very obscure story events. Talk 3 times to an NPC to unlock. A dialogue option, do things in weird soecific order, otherwise the NPC dies, etc. I am not saying it is bad, it's just not my cup of tea. But all in all it is a very solid game, I really like thay you can approach battles with different tactics. Mounted or on foot, using summons, spirits, etc. It give real variety, if something is not working, you can actually change tactics.

Tubey,"Fully reviewing this now after many, many hours, and all I can say is... I heartily regret not being able to give it a 10. It should be a 10, on so many levels, but I can only score it a 9. Why? Well, may as well get the only negative out of the way first - the performance is ropey. I've seen people defend it, and seen some pretending it doesn't even exist, but the brutal honest truth is that the pop in on display here is staggeringly bad and takes you out the game on a consistent basis, and the frame rate is also patchy - not as bad, not enough to make the game unplayable (at least on performance mode) but it is certainly a factor. That's the only negative. In every other respect - gameplay, world building, level design, controls, writing, literally everything - Elden Ring is an absolute masterpiece. It is, without doubt, the best open world game I've ever played, bar none. Breath of the Wild, Skyrim etc. etc. don't have a patch on it - this is a staggering achievement from the developer. I lost count of the amount of times my jaw hit the floor playing this thing, how I was constantly surprised, intrigued, thoroughly lost in its' world. It's not graphical fidelity that draws you in. Elden Ring looks wonderful, but it's because of art design. There are so many games that have wondrous ray-tracing, all the bells and whistles and yet don't look a tenth as good as this thing because it has no visual pop to it. Compare this to, say, Death Stranding - miles upon miles of photorealistic dreariness - and it's chalk and cheese. So many games have combat that is challenging through sheer cheese, or gear gating etc. Elden Ring does it by simply having outstanding combat design. This is a game you could beat without taking a hit, and speedrunners will be doing so before long, because it is brutally difficult yet completely fair. You can count the games that achieve that on one hand, yet Elden Ring makes it look simple. I'm gushing about it here, but I'm not a From Software fanboy, at all. Dark Souls II is one of my most hated games ever. I scored DS3 an 8/10. None of their previous titles break my top 20 of all time, with Bloodborne coming closest. Before now. Elden Ring breaks my personal top five, because it has taken everything good in their prior games, discarded the bad, and polished it all into a package so ludicrously good that it's actually difficult to imagine how this can be bettered. It earns the term 'masterpiece'. Astonishing. ------ (The below was my review in progress.) I'm writing this as a review in progress and will revisit the score if needed - I'm doing it now to counteract the ridiculous reviews from people who I'm 99% sure haven't even beaten Margit, the first boss yet. This is a massive game and needs more than a day or so to review, from anyone. So yes, first impressions - a flawed masterpiece. There are technical issues - the frame rate, even in performance mode, is occasionally janky, and the game is basically unplayable in 30fps quality mode. There is a fair bit of pop in too, and graphical fidelity isn't the best, but the art style is absolutely phenomenal, and that's more important. For the most part, on PS5 the frame rate holds up, and when it does the controls are tight, responsive and the difficulty as such is completely fair. The world itself is astonishingly well done, beautifully crafted with clever enemy placement and always something new to find round every corner. I'll come back in a week or two and review properly, but those scoring below 7 or 8 are well off the mark; even early on you can tell this is a top tier title, and the only real criticisms of it are a lack of accessibility due to difficulty (but not every game has to be for everyone; the developer should be free to make the game they want to make and not have to compromise authenticity) and technical hiccups.",9,2022-03-05,PLAYSTATION 5

trues,"For soulsborne veterans and new players alike. This game has everything. I’m probably 50 hours in to this game and I’m guessing maybe barely halfway through? Maybe less. It’s an incredible experience. I am trying not to rush through it. This game could easily be 100 hours long, maybe more if a person wants to do every single thing. So much content! Challenging but rewarding and fun gameplay. Intriguing fromsoft story telling. Immensely customizable character building and development. Beautiful awe inspiring moments. Magnificent boss design. I honestly can’t find the words for how good this game is. I’ve played for 50 hours and I haven’t felt like any of it is tedious or boring. Went with the confessor and turned it into a paladin and now a faith/melee hybrid battle cleric type with lightning. Really fun to play and looks so cool. First time using magic and it’s been really fun having all the skills and magic spells as well as melee dueling. Love this game. Love that there’s that option in this game. I am someone who started on sekiro. I think that will always be my favorite fromsoft game, but I went onto play bloodborne and dark souls 1-3, so this game feels very familiar in the best way. I am someone who loves the soulsborne series. Love the new open world design. Very cool to go exploring and just roam around. Well done fromsoft team! Thank you!",10,2022-03-05,PLAYSTATION 5
Zackrack,If you want an Open World Dark Souls this is the game. It combines all off the good aspects of the Souls Series as well as tiny bits of Bloodborn and Sekiro. I would 100 % recommend it if you want a hard game. The only manco this game has for me is the laggy/bad koop part of the game,9,2022-03-05,PLAYSTATION 5

XAnthProper,"Do you remember your first? Mine was Dark Souls, following its' predecessor Demon souls (Widely considered a harder game). I've thought each Souls game released since has become easier in small steps and, whether this was due to my consistent meat grinder educational sessions or the actual lowering of the difficulty of their games... I'm unsure, it left me with a desire for something that gave me that same desperate, clawing feeling that the first had given me. This game is absolutely it. It seems that some might also find it ""too easy"" and others ""too challenging"", a CONSTANT discussion to be had among fans and those who hate it alike, but I think one of the most common feelings among the fanbase is the sense of ACCOMPLISHMENT. Which comes at the end of your blade, staff, depravity, cooperation... and how ever long it take you it feels great and, I feel, exponentially more so when you are punished to perfection. I have spent the lion's share of my free time over this last week delving into Elden ring, and have not felt once like I had ENOUGH time. Always wanting for more. This game has already sparked many, among many conversations and each of them are worth their own salt, or gold, or bin stuffing, or what ever! But one of the most common topics I see elsewise, the last I'll address in this particular review, is simply: The wrong way to play. Which I VERY strongly suggest would be to not play it at all. I hope to see you out there, Tarnished. -T EDIT: I would like to add, not wanting to risk looking like a total fan boy, that there are certainly some issues. I've been playing on PS4 and have genuinely seen no performance problems. I haven't tried it on any other platform so my review reflects my experience. If I had to pick something apart it would be that there seems to be some balancing needed in how runes are distributed. Sixty seconds on your preferred search engine will yield you several results as to how to grind at ludicrous rates, some not requiring any fighting even. I think this might be more a nitpick than anything since how other people enjoy a game means very little to how I enjoy it. Now PVP.... PVP is a whole different animal... and once I figure out how to counter the maidenless sub-tarnished that shows up into my world in only tattered sack pants, surrounds themselves in an impenetrable barrier, and spams lightening bolts I can't dodge until my squealing death... I will make them pay.",10,2022-03-05,PLAYSTATION 5

I played every game from fromsoftware except Demons Souls and at the time I liked each and everyone of them. Apart from Sekiro, wich is the best gameplay that I ever experienced, the Dark Souls mechanics feels really dated nowadays and make no mistake: Elden Ring is essencially Dark Souls in a open world. This is basicaly Dark Souls 4. IF YOU LIKE DARK SOULS AND IS NOT FATIGUIED like me, YOU SHOULD BUY IT. But if you thought that after titles like Sekiro and Bloodbourne, Fromsoftware was ready to bring yet another exciting game with diferent mechanics and more over the top Boss fights, this isn't the game for you.

At first yeah it's fun and it's a pretty game, but it's still Playstation 4 graphics on a PS5. Not to mention the performence issues like texture pop in, frame rate dips, and worst of all it doesn't save properly. The more I play the more it feels like Dark Souls. They say you can avoid bosses but after a while you run out of optional bosses and you gotta keep fighting the main bosses which are OP in most cases. Where as the dungeon bosses are a complete joke.

winzentween,"If a Fromsoft game ever needed 'Patches' (sorry) it's this one haha This game should be rated higher but due to the serious technical issues on all systems it has to be a red **** now. Let me explain. Im a huge fromsoft fan and trust only them for day 1 preorders. I've platinumed all their games. Buy It really worries me that blupoint demon souls remaster can launch at 4k 60fps or near to it but elden ring can barely hit 30fps and often dips as low as 15 in sadly the areas where you need consistent performance. I bought a ps5 for improved graphics but all I get is decade old issues which on pc ive left behind with a 3080 though I've Elden ring runs worse on a 3080 than on a ps5 lol There is a whiff of cyberpunk about the game where fans are blindly supporting and conveniently ignoring the serious technical issues which also include a few progression stopping glitches / bugs and the occasional game breaking issue. And post launch the patches are not addressing these issues. It still looks and runs like a...ps3 gen era game but tlou was ps3 and that ran and looked far better so...elden ring just looks ugly. Great art design but everything else is far from the beauty of sekiro or the grandeur of bloodborne. The open world simply fails in 2022. If it was 2010 then I'm sure it be far more impressive as it has 2010 graphics. It's not remotely as good as botw or rdr2 which are games that existed before ER development even started. The latter alone is worrying but the large empty space which witcher 3 dlc would laugh at...isnt much fun to play. Yes You can explore but you'll only find Skyrim like identical copy and paste areas. Forget the wildlife of most open world games or npcs with compelling stories. The George Martin element is inexplicably non existent making the game effectively a dark souls 4. The latter isn't a bad thing but it's not as good as ds3 in visuals / performance or gameplay so where does this leave us? The game isn't suitable for noobs or non fromsoft fans. It's a game seemingly more for fan boys, compromised journalists and shills to scream ""goty!"" while they wait for gameplay saving 'Patches' (sorry ;). It's not a bad game by any means but it has bad aspects to it or lazy maybe. Bloodborne launched in a rough state so this is nothing new but it's still not acceptable. Wait for a sale a year from now when it's been fully patched. Eventually maybe 7-8 /10 but a 4/10 !t launch due to poor technical state :(",4,2022-03-05,PLAYSTATION 5

dmw1,"After listening to all the hype about Elden Ring, the legendary G.R.R.Martin was involved in the story and this game is likely to be the best RPG open world game ever, I thought I would give Elden Ring a go. I booted up the game and was instantly impressed with the character creation so was excited to get stuck in. Now, I have never played a FromSoftware game and I am aware that their games are very hard so I kept that in mind when I died the first few times and accepted my fate. However after hours upon hours of dying, my excitement soon faded. I was getting pretty sick of getting instantly destroyed and was not enjoying myself at all. I decided to read some guides and endless 'GiT gUd ScRuB' comments for some guidance. Souls veterans were saying that the enjoyment comes from finally defeating a tough enemy that has previously been killing you with ease. Yet when I finally managed to defeat the challenging foe, I felt more annoyed with myself that I hadn't killed it sooner and was angry that I had let a game annoy me so much. As I moved on following my victory, I was then able to relive this ordeal and experience the same emotions when I fought my next, harder, nemesis. This revolving door of death, death, small victory and death plunged me in state of anxiety and stress which made me feel legitimately nervous whilst playing this game, eagerly awaiting any enjoyment. To add to the stress are the other game mechanics. There is no quest log so I struggled to keep track of what I was doing, who I have spoken to or where I was meant to be going. Some souls veterans advise new players to use a diary/notebook when playing a FromSoftware game to keep track of quests... Something that could be achieved by having a quest log built into the game. Secondly, the controls often feel pretty sluggish/janky. For example in the heat of (losing yet another) battle, when trying to change my weapon from one-handed to two-handed to deal more damage or mount my steed to make a hasty getaway only to accidentally use some useless item in my pouch has proved to be fatal several times. Also in the same frantic panic, I tried to pause the game to get a bit of respite and check my inventory. As I tried to navigate to complicated pause menu, I quickly learned to my horror that this game does not pause and continues to run which inevitably proved to be fatal. When I finally managed to traverse through the poorly constructed inventory and equipment menu, I found my summons which I had unlocked earlier. I slotted them into my pouch and ventured forth, only to find out that the summons get to pick and chose when and where they can be summoned, which of course, also proved to be fatal.. yet again. Visually, despite being far from 60fps on the PS5, Elden Ring still looks really nice in places and discovering new areas can be exciting. However this excitement was soon replaced by the familiar anxiety and stress of being permanently close to death. Trying to take in a new view was often cut short by a new type of enemy one-shotting me from a mile away or some giant using me for a soft landing. I truly was excited to play this game as it has been hyped and marketed as the best RPG ever. The customisation of your character is brilliant and (although feeling empty and devoid of non-hostile NPCs/towns/markets etc) the open world does feels very explorable. BUT as I've mentioned a few times, the difficulty ruins this game for regular RPG players who are not familiar with or fans of Souls-Borne games. Personally, my free time has become limited due to life taking it's course and I play games to enjoy what spare time I have left. I do not find being held hostage in a constant state of anxiety, stress and annoyance until I pay the ransom of endless trial and error an enjoyable experience. Because of this I have since returned my copy of Elden Ring so I can spend my refunded money on something that will not waste my time.",2,2022-03-05,PLAYSTATION 5

Dumped them into a open world you cant not want to explore and added some new mechanics, such as horse combat, ashes of war and spirit summons. The result, (if you're a fan of the gruelling nature of the games) is a opus magnum, a game that will be referred to in years, not months, to come. Some New players will undoubtedly overwhelmed by the mass of unexplained menu **** took me 15 minutes to realise I had the ability to summon my steed and then had to work out how to equip the ability.

pastaboy,"I have about 50 hours into the game so far and I’m about halfway through. And I’ve missed a LOT of content. I went into this game with unreasonably high expectations and they’ve been met or exceeded across the board. This game is so insanely massive while also rewarding you the more you look, so the world feels far from empty. 9/10 if you see something and think “I wonder if that leads somewhere/does something” it does and it will. Combat, like all fromsoft, titles is fantastic. When you combine ashes of war with the new crafting system or countless spells/items you have a lot of opportunity to create really unique combinations. While bosses can feel unfair the first time you fight them they NEVER are, they’re balanced perfectly so when you defeat them you actually feel like you’ve accomplished something. Also, you can just go and do any dungeon or explore completely (ridiculously large) optional places to build xp and make any fight easier. The world design is fantastic. The map gives you clues as to the direction to go in order to get to an important boss or follow the main path but other than that you are left on your own to find the way. And god how refreshing it is to not have your hand held every single step of the way and to actually just figure it out for yourself. I’ve seen users complaining about performance issues but I haven’t had any so far, no crashes or obvious frame drops (PS5). I’ve also seen users complaining about graphics which I really don’t understand because it has great graphics, just not “next-gen”. But, for me, artistic design will always have more impact than graphical fidelity. I don’t want to talk much about the story yet as I’m still putting all of it together and I don’t want to spoil anything but I’ll just conclude this by saying this: this is my favorite video game ever, and I feel like I’ve barely scratched the surface.",10,2022-03-04,PLAYSTATION 5
Goodraxler,"Elden Ring requires you to explore before continuing on with the main story. You cannot play Elden Ring without exploring the world it has set up.

The game is an easy 10/10. It is honestly one of the best games one can play.

SirMagicPenguin,"This game is brilliant and disappointing at the same time, I feel like a lot of these problems is the symptom of being a open world game. I won't go into technical issues as those could be fixed later on and I want to review the actual game instead of how it looks. Most bosses are amazing and fun to fight while others are some of the worst I have ever seen and I'm surprised they made it into the final game. The early boss fights to me seem higher quality and less gimicky/unfair than the later ones and I found fighting them going from fun to incredibly tedious and boring. The dungeon design is incredibly frustrating with the way forward being chosen a random it seems, I think this was done to encourage exploration but it just leads to multiple times you run loops around a dungeon while getting very confused it makes me thankful for past souls games level design (mostly). I would say this overall is the worst dungeon design in any modern FromSoft game. A lot of the enemy placement in dungeons feels very spiteful as well, It gets tedious where there is a ambush every corridor or a instant kill trap you would not know is there until you died from it. Random enemies normally don't give enough rewards to fight them leading to me just simply running past because I don't feel they are worth my time. I think this is due to the fact there are soo many enemies to fill up the world so they can't give that many rewards to balance the game. Enemies also get reused a lot in the later areas leading to them feeling bland and lazy, including bosses. Like once you fought one dragon or Erdtree avatar you've fought them all. The map did make me want to explore with landmarks but I often found myself saying ""That was it"" or ""That's disappointing"" the map looks more interesting than it actually is to me because I was always getting gear or weapons I will never use. The level differences between areas is extreme where one minute your fine next you do next to no damage and get 1 shotted by everything, I think they should of had a gradient as you went further into areas where enemies got stronger the deeper you went instead of a line where a dog from one side is as weak as a pug and the other as strong as a wolf on steroids. Fighting bosses you can often tell if your underleveled for them since their health goes up a ton leading to a test run of a boss and realising ""Oh I guess I'm too low level"". The bosses are doable at lower levels but incredibly tedious to fight since they take ages since the health bosses have is very generous and one mistake and you get one shotted, but also this works in the other way where bosses you missed feel way too easy and die in seconds. This often makes bosses feel like they are stat checkers. Getting gear is a mixed bag, The builds you can do are amazing and I like the choice but getting that build is another story. You either have to get lucky with what you find or look up a guide since they are so spread out often leading to you feeling really weak cause you don't have anything decent or synergises well. Ashes of war are a good addition and spice up the gameplay is unique ways. Spirit summons are a good feature as well to help out those who need a little extra help. However having as many upgrades as they do for weapons is a little ridiculous and not enough resources drop to give the player much freedom to upgrade loads of weapons to test them out. Sorry for the rant but I love the game just like the other souls games but I am not one to sit back and not admit any of it's mistakes because this game makes many mistakes, and ones not learned from past souls games as well.",7,2022-03-04,PLAYSTATION 5

Muanthuun,"Best open world game since RDR2. The world is immersive, the graphics are impressive. Nearly every corner of each area has a mystery to find. The game doesn't hold your hand. It vaguely tells you where to go next. There are clues spread around the map randomly about interesting places. Exploration is nearly always worthwhile. As for the ""soulsborne"" aspect, combat is solid and more forgiving then in past titles. I love being able to refill flasks from certain mobs or clearing out packs of mobs. Co-op is the easiest it has been in a From Soft title ever. My only real negative and it isn't huge is the lack of haptic usage for the PS5 Dual Sense controller. Sure it vibrates, but really want to use the controller to it's fullest. Hopefully a patch will fix that.",10,2022-03-04,PLAYSTATION 5

ChristopherEO,"I’ve spent 40+ hours in game so far and Elden Ring is honestly incredible in every sense. The world is beautiful, stories it tells are compelling, personally I have nothing but praise for the game. However, Elden Ring clearly isn’t a game for everyone. If you liked the Dark Souls trilogy you’re likely to enjoy this. If you’re going to compare it to RuneScape and complain that it isn’t exactly like RuneScape, you probably will not like it. After going through and reading some of the most positive and negative reviews out there, here’s my breakdown of who is reviewing this game: 0-3: Just salty, plain and simple. Isn’t good at the game and feels is sad and bitter. 4-7: Just not a souls player, have objective critiques but not the target audience for this game. 8-10: Souls veterans, there was no way they’d hate have ever hated game. End of the day everyone doesn’t have to love every game. Saying Elden Ring is “the new Skyrim” I think is attracting an audience who thinks it is an entirely different game than it is. Elden Ring is hard, plain and simple. If you’re going to be salty about that go back to RuneScape.",10,2022-03-04,PLAYSTATION 5

The story, map, characters, enemies, and bosses have all been masterfully designed to provide an unmatched experience of adventuring through a hostile fantasy land.

Tony17,"Dark Souls + Breath of The Wild = Elden Ring. If that sounds like fun to you, then you'll love this game. There's too much good in here for the bad to bring this game to a solid 8. I'd give this game an 8.8 if I could. The Bad: Occasional frame drops in prioritize graphics mode (I only noticed two in 60 hours of gameplay so far so I changed to prioritize frame rate and haven't had an issue since). One of the most detailed character creators to date, however Dark souls type graphics limit what it could be. Multiplayer needs to be updated with some quality fixes. There are occasionally cheap deaths like rooms filled to the brim with hidden enemies. My big gripe is commands in combat should NOT stack especially in a game where a split second decision can mean life or death. It's annoying when the player character does a command you wanted to do 3 seconds ago which is a lot of time in a boss fight. Lastly, I'm reading that a-lot of the enemies are taken from other Souls games and thrown into this one, but i've only played DS1 and Sekiro so it hasn't been a noticeable issue for me. However, these are all nitpicks in what has been an otherwise fantastic experience. The Good: The world is massive, beautiful, and there is so much content that I'm only 16% completed 60 hours in. Enemy variety is unbelievable; No game I've played has even come close to having this many types of enemies. The bosses are tough but (mostly) fair. The game heavily rewards players who explore with better weapons, armor, mechanics and obviously extra levels. If you think you can just run through the main story without exploring you'll get destroyed. Weapon variety is outstanding. There are so many different ways to fight especially with the ashes of war system, which will lead to lots of replay value. Elden Ring is subjectively the easiest FromSoftware game to date (though some players think it's impossible), however the combat is still very challenging and will keep you on your toes any time you venture to a new area. The lore building is fantastic and interesting. There's a sense of wonder that I haven't felt since Skyrim. While the non hostile npcs are few and far between each one is unique and feel important to the games themes and story. Especially since you can summon these npcs in pivotal boss fights. The game makes me want to explore every little thing and I normally skip a lot of side content but the side content in this game almost feels like part of the main story. For players having trouble, if you get stuck on a boss for over an hour that is your queue to leave go out, explore, find better items and level up. Some players review bombing this game don't seem to grasp this concept. I'm not a great souls player and only played DS1 and Sekiro but I beat Margit on my 4th try and Godrick on my 1st. Use summon signs to help you I really don't understand why so many people are rage quitting the game and then crying online ""game bad too hard"" because of these bosses. You don't even have to be good you can just over level if you have to which is very easy to do if you go out of your way to explore the world. Sure it takes time, but this is a massive game it's meant to take a while to finish. At the very least look at a guide on how to build your character to your strengths it only takes one google search. Also, PC reviewers need to stop review bombing the PS5 version. We get it, the PC port has lots of issues. I can't say the same for PS5. Overall this game has been superb.

Chakrom,Was fun at the start when everything seemed more balanced and all builds were doable. But as you get late in the game you're forced to use certain elements and playstyles. Magic isn't nearly as good as in the other souls games. Game has dozens of spells but only a few are good to use the entire game. Co-op is a joke. Both the host and spirit people have their damage and vials reduced by half. Game doesn't give any reason to do co-op other than to play with friends. Game is a lot about exoring and learning to mark on the map where to come back layer to due to being a lower level than what the game expects in areas. I explored and killed all bosses I found and got to the final boss. This game is a joke compared to other souls games.,3,2022-03-04,PLAYSTATION 5

helpermonkey,"Lol, the User Score Wars continue. ""If I feel disappointed in any way then it's a 0/0 score!"" Look, this is absolutely a 10/10 game *if you like Souls games*. Yes it's only a moderate upgrade to DS3 graphics and the gameplay is very similar to previous FromSoftware Souls games but what did users expect it to be? Of course that's what it is. All the gameplay footage and teasers showed exactly that. Why would all these users giving it a 0 or 3 think it was supposed to be something that it has never claimed to be? Again, if you like previous Souls games, this is a fantastic entry. It has all the mechanics explored in DS, Bloodborne and Sekiro thrown into a fun and addictive open world platform. If you disliked those games, you'll dislike this one. If you're simply giving it a 0 score because it was ""overhyped"" then you weren't paying even a little attention to its development.

It doesn't have enough ""living"" in the open world to feel alive, the bosses and enemies are really the part where it shines. It's not as good as Sekiro by far. The plot is lackluster, it seems like they wanted to push the BOTW + Dark Souls angle but the problem with BOTW is that the story suffers for the wondering, explorative world and it was 'okay' that the world felt empty. It feel like a single player MMO experience and you are all alone. I do not feel the game deserves the 10/10. A 10/10 game means that people who are not just dark souls players could enjoy it. I half enjoyed it, half got bored of the empty world. I was so hyped and it has nothing to do with the mechanics, it's just not what I thought it was going to bed. I think it got a perfect 10/10 because people want to relive dark souls. If you wanna relive Dark Souls + BOTW type stuff? This is your jam!

Mbozley,"For all those saying this is a ds3 clone, that is completely false. There has been vast improvements in balancing, with all strategies being viable and effective. An example of this is guard counters. In past games, even when using great shields, you would have to dodge roll to create openings to attack, as there was no way to counter large enemies after blocking an attack. This made blocking Almost useless against larger bosses and enemies, as dodging was almost always more effective. This has been completely solved in elden ring. Performing a heavy attack after blocking an enemy strike activates a guard counter. This attack deals massive damage, as well as having a chance to break your opponents guard for a critical hit. This gives defensive players who prefer to block attacks rather than dodge a very effective way to deal damage. There are many other ways that this game expands on the souls formula (such as bow jump attacks, mounted combat, and more) but this is the best example. Elden ring has the best open world I have ever experienced. It's vibrant and full of life, with many hidden secrets and npcs to discover. The dungeons are great ways to reward exploration. With unique rewards varying from helpful spirit summons to special weapons, I always feel incenavized to explore every nook and cranny of the beautiful open world. While the graphics aren't groundbreaking, the art direction certainly is. The environments are stunning, and the enemy design is grotesque and amazing. I found myself enjoying how the world looks in elden ring much more than horizon (of which many people are comparing elden ring to) simply because of the art design and uniqeness of the landscape. This game is everything I wanted it to be and more, with improved souls combat, a vast and secret packed open world as well as amazing enemies and bosses.",10,2022-03-04,PLAYSTATION 5
its_just_bobs,"I'm 60 hours in, on the final boss, and I can honestly say this is the best game I've ever played. I'm not sure what everyone else is talking about in these low review scores. It's like we are playing a completely different game. I'm playing the PS5 version on PS5 and have had no problems with dipping frames or any graphical errors at all. The visuals are absolutely stunning. I've found myself just stopped and staring at the gorgeous surroundings more than a handful of times. The bosses are difficult, but it never feels unfair. The story is the easiest-to-follow story of any FromSoft game. There are many NPC sidequests to do that make the world feel fleshed out and lived in. There are completely optional areas that make you engage with the world and figure out a way to get there and when you finally figure it out, you feel super accomplished and the game often awards your curiosity with a boss or a rare item. I haven't had this much fun with a game in a long time. Don't listen to all these low reviews of people who haven't even gotten past the first area yet. Elden Ring is a must-buy for everyone.",10,2022-03-04,PLAYSTATION 5
LukeDias42,"I've just finished this game on the PS5. Just like all FS games, this one is ruthless, it will be challenging to long time players and challenging to newcomers. Don't fret, though, please, this game presents you different ways to play, some easier than others and it can be like a puzzle sometimes to decide how to continue, with so many options and enemies that have different weaknesses, you might just need to find what works for the one you having difficulties. Bosses aren't unfair, seriously, they are very predictable, the animations linger long enough to make it clear what will happen, and, again, like a puzzle you just need to discover the correct way to solve it, where to dodge, when to attack, all those are very important, and it is fine to take your time to explore the solutions until you find your own. Most FS games aren't extremely linear, to begin with, but path choices were very conservative, so you could find yourself not able to continue in any avenue, but Elden Ring is open from the very early beginning, allowing you to explore many avenues to explore, you want to go to more difficult parts of the game and try getting loot to help you succeed in the early game? Sure, that's just fine! With so much great content, there will be other stuff to do at any point in the game, so if you are stuck, you can just try it a bit later, with a new weapon. DS3 allowed you to relocate your skills (I sincerely don't remember that about the other FS games), but it was, sincerely, not in the best way possible, forcing you to spend hard to come by items (only a very small amount in the game, earned through PvP), which made it hard to change classes, for fear of not having enough to go back if necessary, however on Elden Ring they help you on you trying different approaches, giving a lot of items used for relocation. Through my playthrough, I was many different things, mage, samurai, Guts and that helped me defeat bosses I was having difficulties with, and it is great to change stuff around, try new things, I enjoyed that. The graphics are great, it's not an FFVII remake, or Guardians of the Galaxy, but, sincerely, it is way bigger with much, much more content, a huge amount of weapons, armour, animations for attacks, bosses, enemies, I mean, it is crazy all this game has, and also, in my opinion, stuff is way more intricate, everywhere you look has something interesting or different worth of your attention, I think that it is fair for games with different scopes and focuses to have different graphics qualities. That said, the graphics are not bad at all, they are a huge step from DS 3, not even close really, bosses I just died while admiring them. The art design went above and beyond, there isn't a single place not telling a story through the architecture or current state of chaos/destruction. The small grass is kinda meh, but I particularly don't care for details that wouldn't add much to the kind of game Elden Ring is. In my experience on the PS5 stutters can happen. However they are usually as soon as a huge open area is loaded, and then they stop, it never occurred to me in any of the dungeons, caves, forts, etc, I never died to any enemy thanks to it, it never lingered long enough for me to get to combat while it happened. That kind of stuff doesn't bother me, it is just while the game loads. That was only my experience on the PS5 though. About the open world, in my first two hours or so I did think it was empty and had nothing to do. However, it was because I hadn't grasped yet the type of open-world it is. In BOTW you go to a high place and scan the surroundings to find new places to explore, in a lot of open-world games you climb something and then the map is revealed to you. Elden Ring is not like that, you need to be attentive, look out for caves and mines, you have to open the map and mark the places you suspect could be interesting, you need to talk to NPCs and try to find where they are leading you, things aren't hidden, but they aren't glaring and out of place, they exist on that world, and they feel like a part of the world, and you have to search for them. When you open your mind to the open-world style of Elden Ring, you understand how fantastic it is to go exploring, and that is innovative. The horse is not only for exploration, it adds a whole new depth to combat, where every weapon has different attacks and combos that are better for different types of enemies. So it was an amazing addition that is also innovative. The story is there, and it is very deep. You go to a town and there are mad people and mad rats on a church with the scroll teaching an incantation that makes others mad. This one is easy to put together, but the whole game is like that, and it is the opposite of lazy, it is fantastic and genius. Try to understand the lore, it will surprise you. Do play Elden Ring.",10,2022-03-04,PLAYSTATION 5
JHood618,"Absolute masterpiece. I’ve played each and every Fromsoftware game since Demon’s Souls ever since I broke through the difficultly barrier and it all finally clicked with Bloodborne. It turned into a massive addiction. I have since played all of them over and over again. I have essentially exclusively played Fromsoftware games since 2015. I’ll continue to do the same. This game is incredible. It is the pinnacle of souls. This makes the prior six games look like trials. They took every great piece of every game they made it put it into one. It doesn’t just feel like Dark Souls III or Sekiro. It feels like Elden Ring. Congratulations Fromsoftware. You have created an absolute masterpiece that continues to subvert my expectations with each passing day I have with this game. I never want it to end. Fromsoftware fan or not, give this a try. It might not be for you but if it is; it is truly something special. I will be playing this for years. Don’t mind the negative reviews from people who don’t have the patience for the difficulty and/or have the unrealistic expectation for a massive triple A game to run flawlessly on day one.

You’ll notice most negative reviewers will have elden ring at 0, but the rest of their reviews are very high, and alot of them have rated Horizon very high, I’m assuming for ratings sake. This game is absolutely phenomenal, I’m over 50 hours in and there’s still more to explore! Of course be aware that this IS a soulsbourne game, so it’s gonna be challenging. If you don’t like a challenge, this isn’t for you, but other than this is my new go to game recommendation!",10,2022-03-04,PLAYSTATION 5

Cheifs14,"If your planning on buying elden ring and playing in between working, family, and having a social life, this is not the game for you. Unless you have endless amount of time to roam around the game and slowly but surely level your character up then this game is certainly for you! As a person who can’t and won’t spend countless hours on a video game, I find this game specifically to be increasingly harder then any of the other dark souls or any other games related to dark souls. I enjoy the mantra of feeling extremely accomplished once you defeat a hard Enemy, but this game takes it to a new level. For anyone who has not played or completed any of the dark souls games, this game will basically be unbeatable. Honestly I cant seem to understand where the 10/10 ratings came from, the graphics are sub-par and the character ability vs enemy ability is just so out of proportion. For a game that i was so unbelievably excited for, this game has ultimately let me down. I expected a sever challenge and was ready for anything this game had to offer, but after a week of being stuck in the same spot with no way to effectively progress through this spot has ultimately turned me away from this game. I congratulate and praise anyone who is skilled enough to be able to surge through the game with minimal pushback from enemies, but it seems me and MANY others do possess the skill or time needed to trek through this game effectively. In no way shape or form do I want the game to change, or have an easy mode or anything like that, i just wish there were ways to use all weapons given to you regardless of arcane level and such. The game needs to be more diversified and give you a fighting chance to be diverse in your attacks towards different enemies. A slow heavy fighter can do a lot of damage, and vise versa, but versus someone who is extremely fast with more health and more damage that you, it’s basically the same result every time. “You Died” over and over again.",4,2022-03-04,PLAYSTATION 5
Xavek,"Best FromSoftware game to date! Elden Ring consumes my every waking thought right now. Soulsbourne fans will see it for the masterpiece it is.

MemeSilenti,"This game is overrated and I don't think so it should be something like game of the year 2022 on PS5 (maybe only in specific genre). I was so excited to play this game even if I´m not soul player but after few hours... I was wondering, am I playing the game that was so presented by media via amazing game trailers and in game footage?? The story looks really lazy and it´s not something what is giving powerful impulse to keep going. The game throw you inside the world just with basic information or without some further story which would give some more explanation what you doing here or who you are... Or maybe I missed something. The next issue is the figures you meet in this game, they miss some big charisma or individual emotions, just walking puppets. Talking about enemies and its AI is so simple like just ordinary scripting of easy-hard fighting modes and nothing more, walking dead bodies. Absence of some kind of life (living persons) makes you feel that you are walking thru the valley of doomed in one of circles belong to hell. This is just about slashing of monsters, soldiers and other freaks on each corner. I can´t avoid a feeling in my self of repetitive action after some time. Like walking thru damn hell which makes you feel more and more bored and bothered in some moments. I have to use one citation: „dying 9000 times against a one million HP bosses all the time isn't fun…“. About fighting and physics of your avatar, ough, the mechanics together with reaction times should be much more improved bcs it really s*cks in some moments (especially at fights). To the next, I think that most of players would welcome an option to choose difficulty level. One more thing, where is some dual-sense effect within PS5? I didn´t notice anything of the character during game play. Graphic aspect of this game looks nicely done but not something of next-gen proportions or something what should blow out my mind. In overall, it´s very good made and looks nice but it´s nothing what brings some new aspects within innovations. I think many things are taken (copied) from other games of same character and retransferred to this game. Example is the placing of messages during game play by other players, this is exactly the thing which has already been brought by Kojima into Death Stranding. I have to admit this is not a game for everyone, you can love it or hate it, nothing between. I much more enjoy game play of Ghost of Tsushima than something like that. I don´t understand the rating of popular magazines, maybe good payed by other side... This game has big potential be a game of games 2022 but this stood in some half way of idea to bring it on this level…",5,2022-03-04,PLAYSTATION 5

Caravaneer,"Elden Ring is phenomenal. While maybe not being the most innovative life changing experience some critics would have you believe. Despite all the technical flaws I believe it stands above and From Software have delivered a master piece. While I do feel it may be too early to post my opinion, I’ve spent 40 hours in the game with no end in sight, I felt the need to post in support as review bombers run rampant. Is this game for everybody? No it’s not. Is this one of the best souls experiences of all time? Personally yes, I believe From Soft has only gotten better with each entry, sekiro being my favorite all around. In reality this is just dark souls 4 but as anyone who was looking forward to this can tell you, that’s exactly what we wanted. If you want a game that doesn’t hold your hand and doesn’t stop you every 5 minutes to remind you of your goals or where to go, and a game that has a satisfying loop of explore, battle, loot, level. This is the game for you. With an open world that so far is unfathomably large detailed and interesting and some of the most interesting enemy and boss encounters in the series. With a ton more freedom to how to build a character. This is easily an all time classic soulsborne experience. The last thing I’ll say is a lot of people complain about the lack of quest logs, mini map, and general map markers, but the game does actually do a very good job of guiding you and keeping you on track. I am the kind of person who gets fatigued by seeing all the incomplete quests and areas I still have to explore, and Elden Ring simply allows you to wander and get lost without asking you to stop and collect 1/500 something’s for a reward. I only have maybe 1/3 or less of the map uncovered with 40 hours in and I have yet to not be surprised around every corner.",9,2022-03-04,PLAYSTATION 5

Method__Man,"Bland and empty. You basically run around in a mostly empty world looking for encounters. It’s the same as any old souls game, non innovative. If you like souls games, this is basically DLC for a previous entry. There is little to no difference Remember, anytime you see 10/10s like this is clearly either bandwagoning or paid reviews. This game is not remotely innovative, and thus cannot earn a perfect score by default. Even for souls players it’s just more of the same Cannot possible exceed mediocre rating. I’m a void, if it was the first ever souls game and breaking a mould, perhaps, but after entry, what?. 5? It’s just more of the same. People critique Farcry for being samey then vomit praise over this clone",6,2022-03-04,PLAYSTATION 5
kushtopia,"The game is fun, no doubt. The boss battles are exhilarating and there is a good variety of enemy types- each with their own distinct feel. There is an underlying story somewhere, but it is told in fragmented/disjointed parts that only the most ardent fans will actually care enough to explore. The graphics are terrible. The animations are terrible. And the game is glitchy and poorly optimized. It feels like an early PS4 release title and does not have anywhere NEAR the style or the polish as other ""next gen"" games. With so many other great options, this is unfortunately a big miss on FromSoftware's part. Poorly told story, unpolished game, with fun gameplay (not necessarily good, just fun) 6.5/10",7,2022-03-04,PLAYSTATION 5
Gunner54,"Is this the ring to rule them all? The game of the decade, the best game ever? The best Soulsbourne game from FromSoftware? That’s for fans of this type of game to decide. Are the graphics last gen? As a generational cross-platform title they are fine and the visual design is breath taking. Is it easier than previous games from the developer? Having tried a couple of previous games I’d agree that it is more ‘accessible’. I spent many hours roaming around the huge map – as long as I didn’t engage in combat (exploring, not lost! lol). I’m sure with enough (and constant) grinding and learning the mechanics and routines of enemies I could progress – maybe even finish the game. But having spent several increasingly boring hours ‘farming’ the same spot I’ve decided that it’s not for me and I’d guess some other gamers having been persuaded by the very pro reviews will be disappointed. Others will love the pain and eventual gain. The PS5 version is buggy. The game has been compared to Skyrim, however, apart from a fantasy setting the only other, significant, aspect it shares with it, is the distracting pop-in and other bugs that SR had on launch. Overall, ER reminded me not of SR but, in some elements, Dragons Dogma (which I enjoyed) - with a huge dollop of Farming Simulator 22 (lol). ER has a world and intriguing lore I know I would love to further explore, but not at the price of dodging the same rock for 5 hours to level up to beat some grunts. Perfect for FromSoftware fans new and old – who may see it as (their) 'the best best game ever'. Everyone else should take the hype and promise of accessibility with a pinch of salt.",8,2022-03-04,PLAYSTATION 5

Yes it has some flaws like any other game but it more than makes up for them by how good the rest is. Negatives: _bosses are repeated in dungeons quite often(but they are 100% optional so no big deal). _A lot enemies can be found in all regions, but all open world games have this(botw has bokoblins everywhere. _The pc port is pretty bad, this is just an L nothing i can say about that but i have the ps5 version and i only had a framedrop after 43 hours of playing. _Horseback battles are not the best (they're still very awkward). _Keeping up with character quests is a headache, a good headache but a headache none the less. Positives: _Insane boss veriety(i think there's like 80 unique bosses). _The most beutiful(not the best looking graphically) i have ever seen. _ Absolutely enormous build options, weapon types, sorceries, incatations, jump attacks, charged attacks, parries, powerstancing(dual weilding) and finally horseback battle. _Amazing story telling/story line(if you are curious enough) _An easy mode for more casual players in the form of spirit summons, coop, npc summons and OP weapons. _spectacular main story bosses. _Many plot twists. _Unparalleled sense of scale. _Great diversity in areas. _Top tier music(as expected of Yuka Kitamura) _Chalenging for those looking for a chalenge. _Jumping (Praise the jumping). _The amazing FromSoft level design.

smitheryinke,"It’s funny to see people who clearly haven’t played anything more challenging than mainstream bait titles zelda botw, ghost of tsushima, assassin’s creed and whatnot, complain about a game that has a 10+ year long history of having the same solid mechanics set in stone. They don’t realize that the difficulty of these games comes from THEM being a **** player because they were seasoned with the titles stated above, titles that reward you for being a **** player. They are not used to challenges. They want quest markers, dungeon markers, npc markers on the map. They want a difficulty setting. They don’t get what “roleplaying” means in these games. You’re not playing as some killing machine that can crush every single enemy as if they were tin cans, you’re playing as a person who seeks to be that strong one day, and you DO become that strong come late game. I hate that this game became a mountain of hype. Sorry but, the souls series doesn’t deserve this treatment. I don’t know why they decided to open it up to the general, more stupid audience. If this game had the same fanbase DS3 had at its release, I guarantee you it would’ve had a fan review score of 98-99.

Blahblahuser,"Let’s just get one thing out of the way. This game is not revolutionary, nor propels the open world genre forward. I don’t think it’s worth a 10 rating but it’s a pretty amazing game. Reviews are after all just opinions made by humans. Now with that out of the way. People review bombing the game while nothing new should really stop. Do you think this game is truly awful? Have you ever actually played an awful and broken game? Apparently not if you think this deserves a 0-4 etc Do I think the game has some issues? Yes particularly when it comes to performance. Honestly the game would get a 10 rating if FromSoftware innovated more, or changed up their formula by adding more variety to their games. The game at its core is still fighting and traps. Where are the inventive puzzles to break the monotony? Gave us a jump button but really didn’t make much use for it besides combat. Honestly I think they are afraid to change up the formula because their last game Sekiro, which was amazing sold less than DS3 and the Dark Souls fanatics are apparently addicted to the same thing. Also to add on to the performance issues the fact that this game has pop-in, and frame rate issues on PS5 or any other version is embarrassing to say the least. The game isn’t pushing any graphical boundaries and is devoid of shadows in tons of areas particularly indoors. Watching a bat flap it’s wings in the distance looking like a stuttering mess is a sight to behold. If I didn’t like the game I would score it lower on these factors.",9,2022-03-04,PLAYSTATION 5

Lots of content that are well made and thought through. Interesting characters and so on. Unlike most other open world games this is actually packed with interesting areas with lots of bosses, dungeons, loot and more. Most other big open world games have vast areas that are boring and filled with dull enemies and a couple of trees. Elden ring surely improves on this entire genre and has probably ruined other games in it. This has taken my number 1 spot of favourite games of all time. those who rated this poorly are just mad that their favourite game got nothing on this.

dump0,"It's clear as hell that this game is a pure meta designed product from the bought reviews to the bought youtubers. It's basically a mash of all the assets and monsters of Dark souls 1-3, Bloodborne and Sekiro, packed up in a meta open world design that absolutely makes no sense for the designed difficulty. You never know if you are losing to a boss because you didn't explore enough or he was just easy because of that. All invasions are fked up, pvp is basically dead and even if not it's most of the time just 2 hit OP arts or magic. While you have 900 bosses it's basically like 30 that repeat itself again and again, as fire, ice, toxic, double bosses or all of that. All the dungeons almost look the same and quickly make no sense to explore since you are very limited in upgrade material. The game also runs like a dog FPS wise and eats inputs. The boss design is extremely flawed since you either get hit by a gimmick instant mechanic that has no visual feedback or you die to an one hit. Bosses onehit or twohit me all the time with over 60 Vigor and Heavy Armor, let that sink. Bosses regardless who never gave me a satisfaction for killing them like Sekiro did. Overall this game is not very outstanding in it's design and could quite honestly be a gigantic fanmade mod.",5,2022-03-03,PLAYSTATION 5
Uvmaister,"Im going to be honest, I was skeptic at first after I heard Elden Ring was going open world. The magic in soulsborne games to me is how FROM guides the players without holding their hands with their linearity. I was worried they’d take a step back from the level design and world building approach we all have been so accustom to. I’m pleased to say I was wrong. The open world is a breath of fresh air and beast of its own. Over the 60+ hours I’ve put into the game so far I’ve had nothing but good times and whenever I put down my controller I immediately want to pick it back up again. It’s intoxicating and anxiety inducing all at once. The vistas, the swamps, the crumbled castles, the dungeons, the lighting and the atmosphere and more is jaw dropping. The world feels alive. The open world fatigue has been a problem for many years now but FROM has managed to take something familiar and make it unfamiliar. They have superseded my expectations in every way possible. Is Elden Ring a perfect game, no. But it’s one of the best open world games ever made if not the best",9,2022-03-03,PLAYSTATION 5
santzera,"Best game i’ve played in my life! The amount of things to discover, explore and fight is breathtaking.

GamezGilmore,"I could argue this being the best game ever made, and I would do it with the research and passion of a presidential debate... I never, ever, thought it possible to have THIS complete **** experience. When I say complete? I mean in the way of FromSoftware making a game that can satisfy every gaming itch you could have, and ones that you didn't even KNOW you have. You want a game with a story and rich lore? This is it. You want a game with fantastic customization options? Its here. You want a huge open world that rewards exploration in every way? That is the best element of this game easily. You want a game that's an ode to the trial-and-error Nintendo era without it being cheap? Look no further. This game is not only the culmination of FromSoftware previous titles; It's a love letter to the entire history of gaming. They've achieved a level of momentum that I haven't seen since SquareSoft in the 90's. This studio knows what they are doing and they are masters of their craft, even as 3rd party developers. As a matter of fact, just give them all the ""Game of the Year"" awards right now because I am certain that no other game will get even close, not even the new God of War or any other triple-A title coming out this year. It is a complete gaming experience that can NOT be missed by anyone that's passionate about gaming culture. FromSoft has set a standard and I can assure you that all of the greatest development studios are studying this game. You could put this game in the Library of Congress now, it's THAT good.",10,2022-03-03,PLAYSTATION 5

Crimson83,"So either there are a lot of trolls or a lot of people who started the game died a couple times and then came here to leave a 0. This game is fantastic and this is coming from someone who has only completed one FromSoft game with it being Sekiro. I have played the other games and own most of them. And anyone saying that these games don't innovate have zero idea what their talking about. The reason this game works so well is because it is using and fine-tuning everything that came before it. Someone on here says, ""All you do is spam L1 and R1"". Yeah good luck breaking enemy guards without using shield parries, jump attacks , charge attacks, and your special abilities. ""The world is boring"" You must not have left the main menu. This is the most natural and varied world design of any open world game. Period. You can't go five minutes in any direction without running into something of interest, whether that be an enemy, hidden area or even just an amazing view. Sure the engine they use is dated and needs some serious updating. But they used their art direction to it's fullest and the game looks gorgeous for how old the engine is. The game has bigs and stutters but nothing I have seen on my Base PS4 that leads me to feel it can't be fixed with a patch or two. The music, character and monster design, the world flow and design. All of it is top notch. And then you have the different builds and abilities you use that give each character numerous ways to play. They also changed how progression works. Before if a boss was too hard you were pretty much stuck until you could get past them. Now if someone is kicking your teeth in, just leave. Yup. Go adventure. Find other things to do. Find new gear and spells. Come back when you're more prepared. That takes a massive load of of any new players because the fun isn't just put on hold until you can beat this boss. You can go have fun elsewhere. So yeah, as someone who was very skeptical if they would like this game let me say that this is a game that needs to be experienced and don't let some troll tell you otherwise.",10,2022-03-03,PLAYSTATION 5
Epicmonk117,"There have been a lot of negative reviews from people for whom this is their first FromSoft title who clearly did not know what they were getting into. Do not listen to them. They did not take the time to learn the game and its many systems and just bashed it for not being just another Jiminy **** open world that holds your hand every step of the way like the stuff Ubisoft puts out. Elden Ring is the exact opposite of that. It may not be the largest open world, but it is DENSE. You cannot go more than 5 minutes without stumbling upon some old ruins, a random dungeon, a hidden secret, a roaming boss, or some other interesting encounter. It's genuinely insane how much stuff they were able to pack into the game with so few repeats. And this gets even more insane inside the big legacy dungeons, which are so sprawling and labyrinthine you could spend hours alone in each one. Every single weapon looks great and feels good to use, and with the ability to change their damage types, attribute scaling, and special abilities using Ashes of War, the depth of character customization has never been higher. These skills are also a lot more varied than they were in previous games, ranging from classics like stomp and spin attack to ranged elemental projectiles to duplicating certain spells to **** in all nearby enemies with the power of gravity. Combat has been improved in many other ways too. Guard breaks now give use to your heavy attacks, jump attacks now have an actual input, and guard counters are some of the most satisfying attacks to land in the entire game. Additionally, the best feature from Dark Souls 2, powerstancing, has returned with a vengeance, and it is glorious. Spells received a similar increase in variety, with a wide array of interesting effects from a spray of chaotic firey bolts that builds a negative status effect on the user to a telekinetic flurry of thrown rocks to transforming into a tiny moon and launching yourself at an enemy. Additionally, many quick-casting spells can be cast much faster after using another action, such as rolling, attacking, or casting another similar spell, while others can be charged to deal even more damage. The only two legitimate problems the game has are the inclusion of Easy Anticheat and the rather poor optimization on PC. At time of writing, I don't know if they've fixed that, but I run the game at medium settings on a PC that barely meets the minimum requirements, and I can play it just fine. The game will occasionally freeze for a couple seconds, but I've never had it crash (though someone I was cooping with at one point did crash once), and occasionally large chunks of the screen will change to a solid color (usually either magenta or cyan) for a single frame, but these performance issues are rather rare and become less frequent the longer my session. As for Easy Anticheat, it's probably the worst anticheat on the market today. While I applaud them for attempting to solve the hacking problem, Easy is hilariously bad at what it does and basically only serves to make it more difficult for players to mod the game in fun ways like the Remastest and Nightfall mods for Dark Souls 1. Overall, even with its performance issues, this is still easily the best game FromSoft has put out and a shoe-in for game of the year, possibly even game of the decade. Hell, it even briefly held the title of second highest-rated game of all time on Metacritic, and still holds #11 at time of writing.",10,2022-03-03,PLAYSTATION 5

Bogey678,"This game is a heuristic nightmare for beginners and was misleading in how it's marketed. It does not feel like an open world when everything resets each time you die or use fast travel. The developer has admitted that George RR Martin didn't write the story, only the mythos. The story is poorly written, some things got lost in translation perhaps. There is an illusion of choice, but there's really only one choice that helps, you will be limited in what you can do in game if you make the wrong choice or until you go back and make the right choice. Your best weapon is Google and others have said, you will die constantly and stare at the loading screen. Defeating a boss feels more like a relief than a sense of accomplishment. I wish there had been a trial period because I never would have spent the time and money on this title. Skill is not as important as level and gear when it comes to defeating bosses, which encourages one to kill the same bosses over and over to level up, then take on the boss with higher gear. The graphics are pretty and that's worth two stars, watch this on Twitch for the best experience.",2,2022-03-03,PLAYSTATION 5
aimes101,I wasted 60 bucks. Should have done more research! I was expecting them to take SOME of the souls stuff and make this sprawling rpg with an amazing story and add some new mechanics to the mix it being 2022. But holy hell. Fighting is clunky there is no sprint that i can find. if an enemy is in my face and i use a spell it goes right through them....I get that it's hard and you die a lot and its supposed to be difficult. I could look past that IF my characters animations weren't ps3 era garbage. Why is that when the bosses look amazing? The graphics are awful.

harveman877,Put over 20 hours into this game where I would normally finish a lot of games and I feel like I've barely scratched the surface. I'm not sure about the PC port as From often has issues there but on the PS5 it is fantastic and I have not had a single issue it has been smooth as butter. Most of the negative reviews are from people who probably shouldn't be playing a game like this anyways and will whine about the difficulty or a few PC gamers with legit issues which are getting patched anyways. With all the buggy trash that has come out recently complaining about this game after Cyberpunk etc. feel like blasphemy to be honest. If you don't like soulsborne the game may not be for you I'm not going to lie its tough but not impossible. I don't get the people comparing this to Horizon totally different games like apples and oranges I guess they came out in the same release window (shrugs). From Software is the only game dev I honestly have faith in anymore and since they delivered after so many recently overhyped games crapped out I just have to applaud what they have done.,10,2022-03-03,PLAYSTATION 5

mjen42,"Elden ring is a phenomenal addition to the dark souls/soulsbourne series. i want to first preface with the fact that this game has nailed the fundamentals, beautiful art smart and smooth game-play and solid ai. There are some issues for console users at the moment but i don't think that should destroy the release review given just how great the rest of the game is. Elden ring is a truly open ended and beautiful world with more stunning variety and play-style choice than any other Soulslike the universal difficulty system works perfectly i have found myself bashing my head against the wall of a difficult boss only to go around it and find dungeons and side bosses and items and then i return to that boss and kick its ass. the world is designed to teach you, if you are capable of listening and learning this game will hone your skill into combat supremacy without you even realizing until after you triumph. The world itself is also lore and story rich with exploration being reward with pieces of story, visage and character development. this game will be as good as you want it to be if you enter expecting freedom and fun you will receive that if you enter expecting combat and triumph against adversity that you will find as you improve. Elden ring is a staple of player freedom and capability, thank you from software.",10,2022-03-03,PLAYSTATION 5

BlimpyPebbles,"Elden Ring is a great game with a lot of flaws. Great combat and exploration are marred by some boring areas and some bad boss fights. The game is great until you get past the Capital and into the Mountaintops of the Giants. From that point on, the game takes a serious nosedive. Areas become tedious, enemies are recycled and the game becomes riddled with artificial difficulty. With a 5-boss rush at the end, and some bosses that seem to be in the wrong game, they seem to have either run out of ideas or run out of time. While a 96 is definitely way too high of a score for this game, Elden Ring is one of FromSoftware’s better titles and definitely not to be missed. Even with its many flaws, the game is still easily a 9/10. It’s that good. *SHADOW OF THE ERDTREE REVIEW* Shadow of the Erdtree is out and while it is massive, it suffers a lot from overly-difficult bosses and severe balancing issues. It also suffers from frame rate dips and texture pop-ins. The map is huge. The DLC is full of content. I haven’t seen a DLC this large since The Shivering Isles for The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion, and this is far bigger. FromSoftware clearly put a lot of time into it. It’s a shame they didn’t give the boss fights the same love and care. At some point, we need to stop pandering to the toxic, immature “git gud” crowd and focus more on making games (and DLCs) as good as possible. Stop making things difficult for difficult’s sake. The boss fights are terrible, even after the balance patch and the fragments and ashes you find in order to level up. The bosses in this DLC are utter garbage. I’m glad people are finally calling FromSoftware out on it. We let the poor balancing and sub-par boss fights slide in Elden Ring, but this is on another level. Overall, a good DLC that suffers from tediousness and overly-difficult, poor boss fights. I was able to beat the DLC and take down every boss and every enemy type. I did it offline and used only spirit ashes; no real people. Having beaten it, I can honestly rate the DLC a 6/10 for its tediousness and overly-difficult, bad boss fights. It makes it really unenjoyable.",9,2022-03-03,PLAYSTATION 5
RiskOfAdventure,"Absolutely phenomenal game. It's combat is far more refined than in from's previous games, its story is huge and mysterious, and its open world is vast and extremely dense. Unfortunately, many people who think that The Last Of Us: Part II's graphics were low to mid-end appear to believe that elden ring looks like its from the 2000's. Although its graphics aren't the peak of the medium right now, I find it impossible to call them bad in good faith, and even if they were, Hidetaka Miyazaki's incredible art direction would make up for it ten-fold. Additionally, many people who have obviously missed the point are arguing that the story is lack-lustre because they can't be bothered to search for it, and prefer to have their story spoon-fed to them as if they were toddlers. there is nothing wrong with this approach to story-telling, but saying that a game is bad because it does not use it is simply childish. Additionally, many negative critics are arguing about other aspects of the game in the same way. they argue that because the game doesn't have swimming, or doesn't have climbing, or doesn't have flying makes the game automatically bad, even though the map was carefully curated with these constraints in mind. by the way, if you see any reviewers saying that the game has an empty open world, or that the environmental design is all the same, or that the combat is the clunkiest out of any of the souls games, or that enemies are recycled from the other souls games, it would be a fair assumption to assume that they have not even played the game or at the very least never left the starting area, as there were people planning on review-bombing the game before it even released, mostly in order to make Horizon: Forbidden West look better, and all of these things are so obviously false that not even a child would have the misfortune of thinking of this game in any of those ways. the one aspect of the game that all of the negative reviewers are saying that is actually correct (other than the language options in other countries and whatnot) is that the performance isn't the best. sometimes the frame rate drops to 30 fps, but it really doesn't take me out of the experience at least and it's pretty hard to tell the difference in my opinion, although I have a past of not caring about frame rates much, if at all. if you are a stickler for frame rates, then I suggest you wait until a patch comes out to fix it, but otherwise I suggest you ignore the people giving the game overwhelmingly negative reviews, because this game is worth far more than every penny of its cost, and I think that almost every person deserves to play it.",10,2022-03-03,PLAYSTATION 5
Dziedzic,"On PC I've had few of the problems, from my own looking into the problems it seems the problems are only with the highest end computers not the mid range computers like mine. On the game play it feels like a more refined and expanded Dark Souls 3, so for those familiar with From Soft think better DS3 with a massive open world. For anyone not familiar with the games, this is a game that takes time and skills that you'll learn by playing, from boss moves and when to attack, roll/jump to not get hit. When playing there's always a way to avoid damage but learning how to get around it will take time. That's to say the ""Get good"" meme is actually the advice due to every playstyle being just as viable as each other, but ultimately Elden Ring just like the other Soulsborn games they aren't easy games that everyone will be able to just pick up, but if you have the time and patience you can get good enough to go the whole game never taking damage at level 1.",10,2022-03-03,PLAYSTATION 5

The gameplay is unmatched in the gaming industry and Elden ring sets new standards again, the controls are as precise as ever.

It is one of the few games that are addictive and that you just can't get enough of. I have to say though that you need to know a few things before you enter the lands between, because Fromsoftware games can be frustrating if you don't take the right approach.

Donelaitis_,"Tough break for Horizon Forbidden West, coming out a week before Elden Ring. Both are fantastic games, but from the moment my copy of Elden Ring arrived, I haven't touched the former. Elden Ring isn't perfect, but it is easily my favorite souls-like game, with Bloodborne coming in second. I'll quickly address the review bombers: most of these 0 scores are clearly bad faith and shouldn't be entertained. On the PS5, I haven't had any performance issues in my 80 hours of gameplay, although I have seen some minor bugs like pop-in which I'm sure will be addressed with future patches. And that's that. For the positives, there are so many. Here are a few of mine that I haven't seen mentioned: 1) HORSE COMBAT. This is by far the coolest addition to the game. It's not mechanically complex, but man it's entertaining to mow down an enemy camp like a 12th century marauder on horseback. And boss battles on horseback, of which there are MANY, take on an epic and high-stakes nature I hadn't previously experienced in a souls-like game. 2) Seamless blend of linear and non-linear gameplay. Some open world games, like GTA 5 and RDR2, do this very poorly. Linear indoor sections feel like an afterthought and the on-the-rails nature of the action kills any sense of tension. In Elden Ring, linear indoor areas and non-linear outdoors areas work seamlessly together to vary up the gameplay. For instance, you're free to wander the open map and engage or not engage enemies as you see fit. But then you venture into a massive castle, or an underground city, and the game takes on the tension, suspense, and danger of previous souls-likes, with traps, ambushes, and puzzles. It's great. 3) An open world game that doesn't hold your hand. Take Horizon for example. Anytime you arrive at a new location, NPCs and points of interest are automatically marked for you on the map with a ?. Quests are listed in the quest log. This is all very convenient, but for me it takes away from the immersion. Quests become a tedious laundry list to complete. Not in Elden Ring though. No quest markers. No quest logs. The only hints you receive are organically in-game and it's up to you to remember them. Just like in REAL LIFE, right?? It's a great concept and encourages you to scour every inch of the detailed world for hidden dungeon entrances, NPCs, merchants, and bosses. As I said above, Elden Ring isn't a perfect game, but it's probably my favorite open world game, BOTW included. I hope this short review has piqued your interest! Don't let the bad faith actors dissuade you.",9,2022-03-03,PLAYSTATION 5

TakeMeToTheER,"These 0 rarings are ridiculous. The game is fun, challenging and has a lot of content. When you start out it will feel intimidating, and the game likes to remind you where your place is, but as you get used to the flow of the game it gets a lot easier. As for the graphics. Its not a photorealistic graphicscard stresstest where every detail down to the sweat rolling down your characters cheek is megacrisp. But does it really need that? Its a unique artstyle with a lot of soul and character to it, and it carries itself beautifully. (Performance issues aside (those will probably be fixed soon anyways)). 10/10. Best game i have played in a few years.",10,2022-03-03,PLAYSTATION 5

Pogge96,"Just finished the game. Had my doubts in the beginning about the open world and that enemys dont scale with you. But i have to say that i love it. But it takes time to get used to it. Performance was absolutely ok for me on my PS5. No issues in boss fights just sometimes a slight lag while exploring (just a second or so). Music is great, its extremely tough even for Souls Veterans. I played every single souls game and I must say that the Elden Ring main Bosses are maybe the hardest of the whole Franchise. I love it and can recommend it to souls veterans. Newbies should maybe start with a normal Dark Souls game. I find a more linear progressions system easier for beginners.",10,2022-03-03,PLAYSTATION 5

Rekthar,"After playing Horizon forbidden west I welcome this change in open world game. The fact that your map isnt full of markers is a great change from other open world games. The lack of quest log is also refreshing. It's nice that you have to learn to play and learn how to navigate around. I've only finished bloodborne before so not really a fan of souls games but this game will propably be my favourite all time game. World is really beautiful, controls feels smooth, lore feels interesting, boss fights are fun and different. There is so much great things in this game and I hate these trolls giving 0s and 1s because they propably didn't even try the game and watched some stream or the didnt have patience to learn after tutorial area.",10,2022-03-03,PLAYSTATION 5

Drifter17x,"Very sad that some users are giving this beautiful piece of gaming history bad scores because of occasional pop in or stutters. I honestly think that most of them didn't even play the game they just wanted an easy mode but ultimately didn't get one, either that or they just want their favorite game to be rated higher. Either way, I am 43 hours into the game and I can say without a doubt that I have never had as many ""ooo"" and ""ahhhhh"" moments while playing a video game. Elden Ring is an RPG lovers Dream, a very dark dream but a wonderful one nonetheless. Combat is a step above DS3 adding different mechanics and weapons. Ashes of war allow for weapon customization ive never experienced in soulsborne game and the spells offer some of the most stunning visuals to date. The big selling point for me is the amount of exploration that can be done while traversing the lands between. Continuously setting a marker on my map to go see what awaits me at my destination only to notice something lurking in the distance or a cave that I would have missed had I not been trying to avoid the enemies in the middle of the area. My only issue with this game is the way quests are tracked, please note I am very familiar with the works of Fromsoft and their approach to quests and the usual exhaustion of dialogue to progress a characters storyline so you can speak with them again in the next area. I just feel it could have been optimized better for a game of this scale. In summary, Elden Ring will be the standard in which I hold for all RPG's moving forward and is undeniably one of the best games I have ever played. Sincerely, your average (not casual) gamer with 27 years of gaming experience.",10,2022-03-03,PLAYSTATION 5

Savagevenom,"Please refrain from coming to do review bombing, this is not just a game, it is a piece of art that reflects the dedication and love of the developers, it is a large-scale dark fantasy world that will make you stick to the screen for hours if you have enough dedication. This is not a game that takes you by the hand and tells you who you should talk to, where you have to go, what objects you should get, basically nothing, because you are the one who must be observant, pay attention to the environment, discover things for yourself, in other words, think. The graphics are the same as what was shown in the demos and previews, if the graphics were not to your liking, why did they buy the game and then come to say that they are bad? The game features some framerate issues on ps5 and other platforms, but that will be fixed over time. The graphics are very good, enough to set us in its story. The gameplay is basically the same as the previous souls, which is more than fine, with more flexible mechanics and we can even jump! The designs of the enemies are excellent, some even scary. The design of the world is the best I've seen in any video game, much better than the Witcher or Zelda, just incomparable and it's going to take your breath away. In conclusion, this game is not for everyone, most of us got more than we expected from the game and beforehand it had already been communicated that the difficulty was going to be similar to its previous games, if you do not like the graphics because it is your opinion but not the absolute truth, because most of us love them.",10,2022-03-03,PLAYSTATION 5

Snowadian,"30 hours in and there is lots to like about this game. It is visually stunning and the creativity/world building is 10/10. The whole experience is not perfect though. The game play is nowhere near as enjoyable as God of War or Ghosts of Tsushima. It feels laborious - more like going to work than taking time off. It is a game built for masochists - those who love extreme challenge - both in skill and in solving puzzles. I'm not sure a casual gamer (without a guide or some Google searches) could get through this game. I can see why professional gamers and reviewers love this game, but anyone who can't commit full time will not. I am not against the difficulty (I don't agree with not having a story mode) but a creator can do as they like, it is their world. It does take away from the experience though for many, including myself. I don't want to spend an hour unable to beat a boss only to give up and go farm runes for another couple of hours so my characters level matches my ability. The feeling of success is not worth it for me. I am also dismayed at the little character customization that is available. I played the astrologer character. I would love more options for my weapons and gear, in 30 hours I've gotten two outfits that I can't make any meaningful customization too and I had to go find a mid game staff in some poisonous swamp to have any chance against bosses. Looking up astrologer outfits, the first cool one is about mid game which I'm guessing I will never see. If you like weapon and outfit choice, choose a melee character with lots of strength and endurance. I beat both God of War and Ghosts of Tsushima - in both games I felt god-like. I felt strong and able. I do not feel this way with Elden Ring. I feel stressed, and overworked. The bit of a rush I got beating Pumpkin head or Margit was not worth the time I put in to do so. The experience is worth seeing but unless you are a committed gamer, I'd suggest waiting for God of War Ragnarok. If you really want to try this game, give Bloodborne a quick try to see what playing at this type of difficulty feels like. I know for a fact that many will feel disappointment after buying this game without reading reviews. The feeling when you beat a hard boss is great, but it is also awful if it ends the game for you because you simply cannot. Great game, that is not for the casual gamer. With GoW and GoT offering story modes/difficulty options, I am disappointed that this is not offered with Elden Ring considering how much money and time was put into this game.",7,2022-03-03,PLAYSTATION 5
hiddensynapse,"Finally, the true successor to Dark Souls. Elden Ring is to Dark Souls what Dark Souls was to Demon Souls. It’s a masterpiece that renders Dark Souls 2 & 3 as somewhat redundant. Don’t expect fast-paced gameplay like Bloodborne and Sekiro; while Elden Ring retains some elements from those games, it’s ultimately about taking a careful and measured approach to combat. For those who loved Dark Souls for its sense of mystery and unparalleled loot, Elden Ring is unbelievably rich and diverse. I doubt any other RPGs exist with as many unique weapons, armor sets, spells, and abilities as Elden Ring. It cranks everything up to 11 and achieves the same level of excellence as From Soft’s greatest (Dark Soul 1, Bloodborne, Sekiro).",10,2022-03-03,PLAYSTATION 5

Johannesk,Review bombers won’t be able to keep this from being remembered as a masterpiece. I gotta jump on here to defend it against the review bombers. This is my first Soulsborne game ever. I’m roughly 40 hours into the game right now. This is not for the casual gamer at all. If you like a challenge and you like puzzle solving and don’t get frustrated easily then you will enjoy it. It honestly is the best game I’ve played in the last few years. It’s not perfect and has plenty of bugs and performance issues but the quality of gameplay and world design absolutely outshines all the bad. People can cry on here all they want but this game will go down as a masterpiece.,10,2022-03-03,PLAYSTATION 5
gjhearn88,"beyond the performance issues and bugs, this game brings almost no new elements to the formula aside from a bland and quite boring open world, and a horse. The visuals seem almost downgraded and very last gen. The combat remains clunky and simplistic. The ""difficulty"" is fabricated by slow animations and opponents that deal outrageous amounts of damage, the ""skill"" required to ""git gud"" is memorizing animations the enemies randomly cycle through. the game is extremely repetitive and tedious the story is almost non-existent, you have to dig and piece it together yourself which feels like a chore. playing with friends online is a nightmare. i feel like this game is average at best. all of the 10/10 scores are baffling.",4,2022-03-03,PLAYSTATION 5
RetroCNY,"This is Miyazaki's magnum opus. Without question. I went into this game with very high expectations, and the reality still managed to blow me away. I haven't played an open world game this content-rich, with this much depth, since either Skyrim or Witcher 3. The world is so vast, there's secrets around every corner. Every zone has multiple sub-zones that you don't even know are there until you stumble onto them. There's even MASSIVE subterranean zones underneath the land's between that you don't even know exist until you find them. There's no invisible walls or plot devices that block your exploration. If you see something that looks cool in the distance, you CAN go there and explore it whenever you want, as long as you can survive the trek to it. The world building at work here, thanks in large part to George R.R Martin's input, is unbelievable and EXTREMELY refreshing to see in a FromSoftware title. Elden Ring feels like a slap in the face to the current game-design dogma that is plaguing the consumer base, where developers rush out half-finished titles lacking in content, only to properly finish the game later with paid DLC. I have put over 80 hours into Elden Ring so far, and I still haven't seen the credits. Seriously, there hasn't been a game that's taken me this long to finish, thanks to how content-rich it is, in over a decade. Easily GOTY material, depending on how good GoW:Ragnarok is. One of the best gaming experiences I've ever had. If you like the souls games, you owe it to yourself to experience Elden Ring. Even if you've only dabbled a bit into them before, you owe yourself a chance to experience it.",10,2022-03-03,PLAYSTATION 5

Digital_Malz,"Let's break into points: 1. A boring repetitive empty giant open world. Generic and recycled bosses and enemies; 2. The same old-style FromSoftware way of telling a story: a boring puzzle that has to be solved through reading hundreds of items descriptions and cryptic conversations with stoned NPCs; 3. Clunky combat system and light-speed bosses from Tekken: rolling through infinite AoE attack combos just to land one or two strikes, repeat; 4. Few pieces of equipment and terrible drop rates. You kill a boss just to receive some useless material; 5. Very beautiful art direction, BUT terrible graphics; 6. Poor performance; 7. Different from Dark Souls, and the others, Elden Ring is mediocre at building tension. Dark Souls is a game that has you always under pressure, theres is little to no rest. You can only feel safe when you're resting at a bonfire. When you play for the first time, you never know what to expect. Enemies are strategically placed, as well as traps. And they're everywhere, all the time. Elden Ring can't do this. There are long pauses to ""commune with nature"", because the big empty open world is not threatening. You can see the enemies from distance, and you're never caught by surprise. The way from Ruin A to Ruin B is safe and sound... And once you approach Ruin B, you know ""ok, now I'll face some challenge"", at this moment, there's no tension, it was ruined by the anticipation. You always know what to expect and when; 8. Multiplayer is the same old song: dependant on consumable items and limited to smoke walls. FS could have delivered a true multiplayer, but they are too addicted to the same old colorful phantoms paradigma. Am I saying the game is not good? No, I'm not. I'm just convicted that Elden Ring is far from being the Eight World Wonder that media wants it to be. Way too far from 97 on Metacritic. In my opinion, the worst among it's siblings.",5,2022-03-03,PLAYSTATION 5
HrGjerdingSmith,"Elden Ring! What a massive game of hot stuff. The combat and the horse riding is so smooth. It’s also very very fun. It’s so amazing riding through this massive world. The world is felt with microscopic details, several dungeons, big castles and churches, elves, cliffs, mountains, plains, camps and much much more. I never get bored doing it. The graphics is also fantastic. A souls-game have never looked better. The grass and threes are living. The same as every animal and creature who exists here. The people you can meet and talk with feels as humans and the lore is filled in these characters. You’ll meet kings, wizards, knights, traders and much much more. The music and sound design in this game is also mega iconic. It fits so perfect with the boss battles, fights and the exploration. It’s a very difficult game to manage, but it feels so good when you finally learn how to take them down and manages to kill them. It’s no more than a masterpiece. 10/10",10,2022-03-03,PLAYSTATION 5

jazzathan,"This game is absolutely insane. It does a fantastic job of being challenging and hard without being frustrating and anger-inducing. Every time you think you’ve discovered all of the map, or searched a dungeon, there’s always one more thing to keep you immersed into the beautifully intricate world. The soundtrack is one of the only in games i’ve played that’s made me feel a chill down my spine, and the boss themes enhance the feeling of grandness as you fight monstrosity after monstrosity. Despite its stat and inventory limitations (which isn’t a bad thing, it’s even more of an incentive to find treasure), you’re given complete freedom from the moment you step past the tutorial. There’s a main story that can be picked up and dropped at any point in the game, allowing for getting better gear or weapon upgrades, general exploration, or just taking a break to buy more supplies. Almost every aspect of this game blows me away, and i think it’s an absolute must play.",10,2022-03-03,PLAYSTATION 5

The game offers a plenty of options to make your journey easy: the horse, you can summon spirits to help you, you can summon friends, so please, no lame excuses! The game may be still challenging(gladly!) but way more accessible than any other souls games. So of you write a review, please make sure to play it for at least 10 hours. Bottom line: a masterpiece!

Did it live up to the hype? **** yeah! positive + Absolutely massive world with enough variation + great art work + some genius enemy designs + some of the hardest and best bosses fromsoft ever made + combat is now way more in depth , r1 spamming is still possible but against tougher bosses you will need more tricks up your sleeve. + Dozens of weapons , some are absolutely incredible. + great music again + the legacy dungeons are mostly fantastic negative - i consider this as my biggest complaint: pls fromsoft if you can't come up with a new boss, DON'T re-use them or put 2 re-used bosses in 1 room. Just come up with something new or don't make them at all. - i said most legacy dungeons are good because i found raya lucaria to be disapointing, it looked awesome in the trailers but it was pretty small and did not come up with anything new. - perfomance issues I see a lot of unknowing people in the user reviews that give the game below a 7 , they clearly did not do any effort in looking features up, which is not even necessary because this game guides you enough if you read everything . But people are to lazy to read anyway . If you are reading this then bravo atleast you put some effort in reading this review :) . The only valid criticism you can give is the ones i listed and if you just don't like open world games which i understand.

In fact, there isn't really anything new at all. Sure names and systems are changed but they are fundamentally the same. The graphics work, Sound design, animations, and frankly just all the visuals are very subpar. This game does not look good by any means but it does have fantastic art direction which go a long way.

Jonathan_j,"WARNING! Don't trust any reviews that gave the game a score under 5! A score like that is insulting to the developers who spent a lot of time creating this game. I am a huge Souls fan so my score is a bit bias. Some people mention the outdated graphics and yes the graphics aren't as good looking as the new horizon game, and there might be some pop-ins here and there, and yet this is still one of the most beautiful games I've ever played, because of the incredible art style. Other reviews mention the difficulty as being a bad part of the game, the game is mechanically difficult, this means that the enemies have complicated and fast move sets and you will die a lot, so of you don't enjoy that, I don't recommend the game. I've seen a lot of people mention that the game is empty, that is also false, the game is full of content and secrets, I have to admit that the sidequests and lore are very cryptic, this is also something that people criticized as being something bad but that is also incorrect. The game doesn't shove the story in your face rather it just roughly explains what's going on in the world whilst hiding a lot of the details under the hood. The main problem with those reviews is that they're comparing EldenRing to other open world games that are great and then say that ER is bad because it does things differently. I'll give an analogy to the absent story argument, let's say there's a sushi chef and he makes the best sushi in the world, like it's perfectly done, the rice is perfectly cooked, the fish is fresh from the market and there's a perfect amount of sauce. That would make it an objectively good sushi right? Would it then make sense to criticize the sushi for not having fries as a side dish when that was never the point of the meal? Of course not and in ER's case the fries is the story, Miyazaki never meant for EldenRing to have a storyline as the main part of the game. So if you're expecting a deep story like the Witcher3 I also don't recommend the game. However if you want to immerse yourself in an incredibly diverse and challenging world, where you can play with tons of different playstyles and if you enjoy exploration, the game is absolutely for you, of course there's much more to the game than the previously mentioned points, but those are things you'll find out for yourself !",10,2022-03-03,PLAYSTATION 5

Tuetenhenkel,"I love Soulslike games, but my expectations for Elden Ring were low from the start. Souls and Open World, does it work? Well, unfortunately not for me. What I like about Soulslikes is the intense combat, the danger that can lurk around every corner. In Elden Ring we can already see the opponents from afar, we can easily walk around them and even if they see us, we can flee in a flash with our mount. Only in the dungeons there is a bit of atmosphere, unfortunately they are designed quite repetitive and mostly have bosses that are not worth remembering. The open world itself is pretty boring in my opinion, there's a lot of idleness. Sure, you might say now, just ignore the optional areas. But that's not really possible, because every now and then there are more or less useful rewards waiting for you. So like any other Ubisoft game, it often feels like work here too. I scour the entire open world, putting in several hours to MAYBE find a better weapon, armor, or spell. Most of the time, however, it were items that didn't fit my build at all, which only made the disappointment even greater. I don't even want to start with crafting. Collect plants and hunt animals to make arrows? This might be fun for the first five minutes, but eventually you just roll your eyes when you run out of arrows. Luckily, you can later buy these from merchants and don't have to waste time farming. Elden Ring is not a total disaster. In its core disciplines, it is just as much fun as the previous titles. Only the open world makes the game too easy and fills it with too much idleness and boredom. Personally, I would like FromSoftware to go back to the menacing, atmospheric, yet rewardingly explorable and well designed linear levels. Oh, and a new setting would be very refreshing, I don't really need a Dark Souls 5.",5,2022-03-03,PLAYSTATION 5

SaschaL,"Id rate this game a 9 but want to counter some of the review bombing. It seems like many people fell into the game because of the hype unprepared for how fromsoft does its storytelling. If you talk to npcs and read item descriptions the rich story comes together very well. The world is chockfull of great gear and unique encounters. And folks who think comparing the mechanics to previous fromsoft titles is a reason for a low score confuse me. There is plenty added to the combat system and a new degree of verticality that makes exploring better than its ever been. Im about 50hrs in and still getting surprised by things, and still feel engaged. Didnt have to grind once. If something in the map feels hard, come back to it later, not a tricky concept in open world games. I will say that the performance issues at launch are problematic, but nothing that wont get addressed in patches. The game is hard, but the open world helps with accessibility since you can try somewhere else. I will critique that the game should imply more thoroughly that following the main bath for a bit first nets you the ability to level, travel faster, and use items that help your progression. Missing those and wandering off is a possibility. Im probably a fromsoft fanboy, and this game requires time and immersive investment. But I think its great, and doesnt deserve to get review bombed by people who didnt bother to listen to the npcs talk about the world.",10,2022-03-03,PLAYSTATION 5
Phantox10,"Como un apasionado de la Saga Souls puedo decir que este titulo es fantástico, he tenido la suerte de probarlo en PS5 y PC, pero cabe mencionar que aun se encuentra muy mal optimizado en el segundo. El único punto negativo que puedo encontrar serían las invocaciones, estas resultan demasiado rotas a mi parecer, solo invocando unos lobos espirituales se puede derrotar a mas del 70% de los jefes de este juego, es una mecánica muy valida, ya que el mismo juego la permite desarrollar, pero siento que contrasta con la idea de dificultad de un Souls.",9,2022-03-03,PLAYSTATION 5

For those who have already played DS, it could be a ""more of the same"", but it is much improved in the mechanics and in the possibilities of the game.

If you like the standard AAA formula of 5 hours of tutorials followed by a bunch of side quests dumped on your map to walk between point A and B then this game is probably not for you. If you want to be able to kill every enemy straight away as soon as you meet them without practicing or having the discipline to leave it and come back when you're ready then this game is probably not for you. If this game is not for you then that's ok, but the game is not ""unfair"" or ""outdated"". It's very fair, but it requires patience, discipline and some intelligence to actually try doing something else if the thing you're doing is too difficult (people complaining they spent 40 tries on a single enemy, perhaps explore a different area first?) If you persevere past the first major boss then you'll probably think this game is 10/10. If you don't then you will think it's garbage.",10,2022-03-03,PLAYSTATION 5
wdywfv,"After 40+ hours with the game, I can definitely say that it's one of the best open world games I've ever had the chance to play. Unlike most open world games that release nowadays, Elden Ring does not hold your hand constantly throughout your adventure, but instead gives you the core tools in order to go out and explore the huge world at your own pace. It really does feel like everywhere you go, you will encounter some interesting creatures, npcs, locations and bosses. I believe that this is the most beginner friendly game from FromSoftware, as everytime you hit a wall you can just go someplace else and get stronger. Regarding the difficulty, it's what you'd expect from a FromSoftware game. It packs a challenge, but it does provide all sorts of tools that you can use to ease your experience. Regarding the combat, you can tell that they have picked mechanics from all of their previous games, and it feels more fluid and developed than ever. The art direction is amazing, from the moment you step outside into the world you are hit with a wonderful scenery and this stays consistent throughout the game. I did not have any performance issues, the game stayed at a constant 55-60 fps on Performance Mode (PS5) and I've only experienced one minor bug. I would take low ratings seen here with a grain of salt, it appears that they mostly come from people who were not familiar with FromSoftware's game style but bought the game without any research due to hype. If you like a game constantly telling you what to do, providing no challenge whatsoever, duplicating the same locations and enemies throughout the whole map while using basic and clunky fighting mechanics (basically most open world games nowadays), Elden Ring is not the game for you. Otherwise, if you're looking for an adventure where you will feel extremely immersed and where you can feel like you are slowly getting better as you explore the world, please play it as soon as possible.",10,2022-03-03,PLAYSTATION 5

Acrolis,"Elden Ring is a Souls game at its core, but it's the ultimate version of a Souls game. It feels like the culmination of everything From Software has worked on in the last 15 years coming together in one incredible package. A massive, beautiful open world with dungeons all throughout. Top tier boss fights, and combat that's been refined, adopting some elements from previous FS games and introducing new mechanics like the guard counter. interesting and complex level design that will have you obsessively searching around every corner, and now with a whole new element of verticality thanks to jumping being introduced. RPG character building and stat allocation, allowing you to customize in depth what kind of character you want to play. If you're a fan of From Software's previous works it's 100% a must play. The issue with the user reviews of this game is that it's the first From Soft game to truly catch the attention of the masses. These games do not hold your hand and they're not afraid to kick you into the dirt. I have a feeling this left a lot of people frustrated on first impression, who then promptly dropped the game and proceeded to write a negative review blaming their lack of ability on the game. If you're new to this series, keep in mind that it takes patience and persistence. It will be difficult at times, but you'll learn and overcome, eventually mastering the game, and I think once you do, these games offer an experience like no other.",10,2022-03-03,PLAYSTATION 5

eldenringisgarb,"DONT BUY. Melee dex is completely freaking useless I had to farm endlessly as a dex melee character to beat the second boss, I farmed til I was level 50 while he is like a level 20. Meanwhile mages are one shotting bosses. This game is just beyond awful. If you play a melee character you will die endlessly, as every boss and miniboss and strong normal mobs have aoe attack with tracing! Oh and also 80%+ are faster than you. Not to mention theres both input delay and input que take when you dodge roll for instance so the roll happens 0.5 sec later (great design in a reflex game, real genius) and regarding input delay you will die many a time due to your character deciding to do a command 2 commands ago. Also this games design is just awful, damn awful. Lets compare this awful game to some of my favorite games like take dota 2, (the real hardest game in the world not filled with BS mechanics) and diablo 2. In dota 2 all heroes are free and everyone is at equal footing since everyone can pick everyone. This means that even though you might die to another hero you can just spam that hero from now on and realise his strengths and weaknesses after 10-100 games. In diablo 2 theres this frustrating mechanic called hit recovery. What it does is it stunlocks you if damage taken exceeds 12% of max life. Now it can be very annoying getting stun locked to death, but this leads me to my point: in diablo 2 the enemys ALSO HAS HIT RECOVERY. IN OTHER WORDS ITS AN EVEN PLAYING FIELD. I CAN STUNLOCK THEM TO DEATH ALSO LEADING ME TO NOT GET MAD IF I GET STUN LOCKED TO DEATH COMPLETELY UNLIKE ELDEN RING, WHERE BOSSES HAVE ENDLESS STAMINA (unlike the melee characters who can only do 4 hits, or atleast samurai can only do that the character im playing..). Enemys also often 2 or 3 shot me while I have put the last 30 levels into damage through dexterity and gotten ONE damage point per level. ONE. This game isnt even hard like the fanboys claim (and then just insult you and tell you to get good when you call out bosses tracing you mid attack during a dodge roll) its just watching, waiting to get a single or two hits in if youre melee then trying to bait out the correct range to do it again. The bosses have much more fun than the player characters they actually have cool combos and skillsets and get to play the game, the player character just stands and runs around waiting for the bosses endless combos to end.

This game needs a warning on its cover: ""not another ubi-like game"" No, seriously, I'm so tired of games that constantly hold my hand and treat me like I'm a child. Unlike FarCry, Horizon, Ghost of Tsushima, Assassins Creed and others, Elden Ring trust its players. Here you get to truly explore a world in ruins. It's a beautiful and mysterious land. You see a castle far away? An abandoned house? A cavern entrance? Maybe go take a look. And be sure you'll find a location that is so unique it doesn't need question marks or a compass pointing to it. Same for the non-player characters and their quests. They also feel unique and tailored to be memorable. Not the traditional ""fetch x pieces of wood"", ""kill x boars"" nonsense you see anywhere else. This game respects your time. What to say about the combat? Deep and strategic, simply put. Again, if you face your enemies like you would have done in Assassins Creed you're in for a world of pain and frustration. Combat in Elden Ring is all about observing, learning and committing to each and every action you perform. Take for instance Tree Sentinel. Bastard demolished me for at least two hours, but I eventually killed him, though not before I learned his attacks (and took some good rest so my brain could absorb what I learned). And that's how it was meant to be. Tree Sentinel is now a satisfying memory of a challenge I overcame. See you again in NG+ my friend. Sadly this game is not for everyone, and it's fine.

If this is your first time, it's the best time to jump in, as the open world allows you to come back to an area later if you're struggling with it. What I love about these games, is that it lets you explore the world without necessarily throwing everything in your face. It leaves a lot open for you to interpret, in the best way. I also love the feeling of struggling with a boss, but figuring out his pattern and moves step by step, until finally you beat him after you just feel so accomplished. Not to mention the different playstyles you can go for, the different weapons you can use and on top of that the improved magic system. Elden Ring definitely gets close to a 10 for me, personally, and with the fake reviews, and the pretentious people seeking attention by giving it a 0 because ""it's DS3"", I definitely think it deserves it.",10,2022-03-03,PLAYSTATION 5

Honestx,"I was never a fan of the souls game series. And even after completing the ps5 remake of demon souls I am still not fond of the series. I would give demon souls a 8.5 because I really enjoyed it and I never played anything like it but the slow paced constant death gameplay is not my cup of tea. Elden ring combines souls combat with a very dense and detailed open world and a decent story in my opinion. I haven't finished the game yet but I have watched gameplays and review and though I do see why many regard this game as the game of the year. In my personal opinion I find souls combat repetitive and somewhat boring. Don't get me wrong the open world is amazing, in fact most of the hours I put onto the game are me just exploring what the world has to offer. If you are into souls games give this a try. If you are not into souls games then this won't change your thoughts on the saga. 7/10 not my cup of tea, demon souls was better in my opinion, boring outdated combat, bad performance, okay story. What carries this game is the open world.",7,2022-03-03,PLAYSTATION 5

Mbock001,"The game is amazing, every evolution from all their IPs have gone into the game making it amazing. Yes it is difficult it is a From Software game, but it is easier than the rest due to the open world, giving you the ability to become over leveled for bosses to make them sit ificantly easier.. the only reason this is not a 10/10 is the lack of optimization, very rarely am I running 60fps on ps5 and texture pop in is every where you travel.

Most people i see complaining here in the reviews clearly never played another fromsoftware game before and just bought it because of the hype. People are crying about the fact that the story isn't obvious and that there are no clear objectives. But that is kinda the point in all of the fromsoftware games. if you want to know the lore you got to look for it yourself. people are also complaining that this game is just darksouls 4 with open world. thats right. if you don't like that, then this game is indeed not for you. the only reason why this game is a 9 and not a 10 is because of the minor performance issues. sometimes the fps drops to 30. and the game is indeed not as beautiful as other ps5 titles like demon's souls. but for me personally that is not really an issue.",9,2022-03-03,PLAYSTATION 5

You can play as a mage who uses spells or even as a loincloth wearing guy with a giant club. Game offers also a horse named Torrent which you can use to travel even long distances in the vast open world that has many beautiful sceneries. Elden Ring’s graphics aren’t anything special when you compare it to other games on PS5. Game looks still amazing with the PS5 even thou there are few times when some things have lower texture quality. These little flaws game patches with its outstanding art direction.

No. Last gen looking graphics with a fair amount of pop in and frame drops, cheap deaths i.e. bad hit boxes or being stabbed through solid walls, and the overall souls mechanic keep it from being a 9 or 10 for me. This game has made me realize that I just don’t like souls games. I don’t like the lack of difficulty settings, I don’t like the laggy/delayed button inputs, I don’t like not having real checkpoints, I don’t like losing all my xp when I die. It’s just not for me. However, I find myself enjoying the world they built. It’s interesting enough to make up for all the stuff I don’t like. The lore and character/world design is amazing and that by itself has kept me playing and invested, hence my rating.

It's the culmination of all the games that came before - Demon Souls, Dark Souls, Bloodborne and Sekiro, but the world is much more expansive, rich with lores, great gameplay, amazing locations, mind-blowing soundtracks, and grounded characters.

Elden Ring is less than 45 gig. Demon souls are around 100 gigs. You can tell the graphics and loading speeds are way better. The price tag should be less.

TheRealReal,"I’m a regular person playing this game. I’ve never rated a game on this website and I thought I would do so with this one. This is by far the least accessible souls I’ve played out of all the soulstitles. I’ll say the pros. The pros are the visuals, the music throughout the game, the combat system, and more. But bro , the boss battles are so stupidly implemented with one shot mechanics and unavoidable randomized attacks. I’m currently on the last boss, I have completed the game up to that point and I would never recommend this game to a newcomer or a friend trying to get into the series. Even for me somebody who has beaten all the souls games in the past, the bosses on this game are on a different level compared to past souls entries. I would say if you’re playing the game in terms of starting to mid level you’re going to have a great time. But close to endgame types of bosses, you’re going to spend countless hours due to one shot mechanics that even at high vigor will not save you from unless you overlevel which I feel should not be needed for these types of games because it feels cheap. I feel that the difficulty of these late bosses are implemented so poorly that I feel a number of people will give up due to their cheap mechanics. This game is just good at the beginning but late game is so terrible with these fights and I don’t know why they think good gameplay should include one shot mechanics and randomized unavoidable attacks that take so many hours to master.",5,2022-03-02,PLAYSTATION 5

Cyb3rs34l,"While the game is fun I can only give it a 5 out of 10 strictly because its abusive toward the consumer as far as how straight punishing combat is. What I mean is bosses have very small hit boxes an can strike through walls an objects while your weapons bounce off of walls an objects an cannot hit the enemy through objects that cause collision like they can. Then bosses tend to move very fast an deal massive damage almost once shotting you every time, if your a meele build the game will punish you even worse but not as bad for casters. A game should be enjoyable you shouldn't be dying 30 times in a row just to get by an enemy, an people can say get good but that isn't even half the problem, most of the time you can't find the things needed to upgrade your weapons an the only armour altering down grades it absolutely nothing yet to improve it. On top of this their is times the enemy's weapon clearly did not strike me but I still take damage from them, then they also have you fighting multiple fast moving bosses at one time. Nothing about encounters is really fun with over 100 hours in I find myself constantly getting more an frustrated with the overall decision making as far as combat goes because it is no longer fun but more makes me want to send foul nasty messages to the devs because they clearly don't know the correct mix between fun an challenging what this game is, is strictly crap all the good an wonderful things about it arw straight ruined by super challenging enemy's an if you die well you lose all your experience making leveling harder because its also your money too. Then lets get into the crap frame rate that is constantly dipping close an close to 30FPS rather than 60. Then you also have idiot players leaving messages on things you need to interact with making offline play almost a necessity because it becomes annoying while playing. No point really in greater runes either because you have to find a rune arc to activate them but they seem to be in very limited supply or cost over 4000 exp a pop. While I started off loving the game now that I am on the mountain of giants area I am ready to quit over just not being able to kill anything because enemy's disappear an then are instantly behind you then throw combo after combo relentless leaving you no opening whatsoever an if you do strike they are never stund like you are but can attack through all your moves an kill you instantly. This game is not a must play at all it is a beautifully crafted game utterly ruined by combat alone.",3,2022-03-02,PLAYSTATION 5

DrywallDevourer,"STORY: Unlike Dark Souls, Elden Ring has a very clear-cut story, rather than putting bits and pieces of it in dialogue and item descriptions, it very clearly tells you what's going on and why you're doing what you must. GRAPHICS: The graphics are beautiful, some of the best in a game I've seen. However, it's not game breaking like Demon Souls, and that's fine, fans of the souls series never came for the graphics, but they were always appreciated. The graphics have their good moments, and their bad ones. For example, the door to the walking mausoleum is extremely low quality, it's unsettling, but not enough to remove a point from the score. The fight against Rennala Queen of The Full Moon was gorgeous, the look of the spells is better than they've ever been. GAMEPLAY: Elden Ring rewards players for exploration, whether the reward is smithing stones for upgrades, or one of 83 bosses in the game, no matter which one however, the player is guaranteed to get an item that might be of use to them. Unlike past games, Elden Ring allows you to prepare for bosses, to come back whenever you're stronger after being defeated by a boss you weren't able to defeat, this allows the game to be either the hardest of all Fromsoftware games, or the easiest, depending on how you play. COMBAT: This will be short. The combat in Elden Ring is the basic combat we're used to in every other souls game, but better. In Dark Souls you'd typically dodge the boss waiting for an opening, then use your regular attack. However, Elden Ring has adopted the posture system from Sekiro, making heavy attacks and jumping heavy attacks used more. The bosses as I've seen are also more aggressive than previous games. You can't just go in with heavy armor and a big weapon expecting to defeat the boss easily, you have to find out their moves, see which ones give the biggest openings for attacks, and hopefully get a hit in. Torrent, the spectral steed that you get early on, also contributes much to fights. Often times you'll find yourself relying on Torrent to have an easier time with some bosses. PERFORMANCE: At launch the performance on PC was poor to say the least, which is understandable seeing as this is the first time Fromsoftware has done an open world game like Elden Ring. However, patches are being released in order to fix optimization issues. A patch was released recently which seemed to fix the issue, if not at least a little bit. If you're a person who's always wanted to play a game like Dark Souls but is afraid of the difficulty, now is the time to purchase Elden Ring. If you don't like it, you can always refund it on Steam.",10,2022-03-02,PLAYSTATION 5

gamesreviewer35,"The name Elden Ring in itself is misleading. It's Elden Ring in name only. Should have just been called Dark Souls 4 instead as its the same tried and tried Dark Souls gameplay with the addition of an open world map and a horse. Enemy, dungeon variety and some backgrounds resembling paintings are some of the only unique redeeming features in an otherwise totally mediocre package with a boring empty world to navigate, no interesting navigation in the world outside of horse mounts, washed out last-gen visuals with a bleak depressing setting as well as numerous performance issues that are evident throughout. After giving this game a second chance, I just cannot see how this game possibly deserved all time high scores from reviewers. Maybe down the line with some additional DLC the game might improve further, but right now, I cannot recommend this game to anyone other than dedicated Souls fans. This has to go down as one of the most shameful chapters in game review history (with reviewers bias blatantly turning a blind eye to the games issues) with Elden Ring becoming one of the most overrated games of all time.

FROMSOFT isn't known for having the best graphics, but in this game, the graphics are good, especially for a game that prioritizes gameplay, the scenery is to die for. The difficulty is a notch higher than other games, but it isn't greater than the other games in the SoulsBorne series, making this the easiest way to start a venture into the franchise.

ElDobleK,"Elden Ring is brilliant and one of the very best games I've ever played. Fans of FromSoft's previous games should absolutely NOT miss this one, and even fans who have never played a Soulslike should give it a try. Its massive open world sets new standards for depth & detail and is simply filled to the brim with secrets to find, dungeons to explore, and foes to slay. Combat is just as tough as in previous FromSoft games, but Elden Ring offers build variety and supportive mechanics that take some of the edge off of the harder bosses. The freedom to leave & explore another area, instead of just banging your head against a single boss fight, really shakes up the FromSoft formula. I think this freedom will be one of the main factors that allows novices to ease into its style of gameplay. At the time of writing I am currently experiencing occasional frame stutters, during which my FPS drops from a steady 60 to mid-40s. These typically occur in the Open World, when transitioning between areas of the map. I'm confident FromSoft will fix the issue with patches (no, not THAT Patches), and my experience with it simply isn't enough for me to not recommend Elden Ring to others. For reference, I am playing on an i7-10700KF with an RTX 3070 and 32 GB of RAM, with all settings turned to High and resolution at 1440. The game is the culmination of the FromSoft formula and shouldn't be missed.

EldenCringe2022,"Anyone saying that graphics are not bad or ""there are no graphics issues on PS5 blah blah blah"" is either lying or needs to play other games, than just Souls games. These graphics are worse than any AAA game from 2015/2016. This is NOT something you can make arguments for or argue about. These are simple facts and you can verify them very easily by either playing older games or just checking Youtube videos of these games. Ironically outdated graphics are not the main issue with this game at all. My god, games in 2015 looked great. GTA 5 on PC that came out April 2015, looks still phenomenally good. So i have zero issues with 2015 graphics, i love 2015 graphics, but not on 2022 games, that should have 2022 graphics. Is this too complicated to understand for fanboys? But even then, i could play it with these graphics, if actual game itself was good. Sadly it's far, far from good. It's extremely mediocre, world is E M P T Y. There's nothing but empty areas between caves and monster locations and then you find some small ruins here or there. That's the whole map design. That's bad. That's amateur level or map designing. Story is there, but it's not nearly fun or interesting enough, that i would spend hours learning every boss move sets. I actually liked how bosses looked like (like their look, not how they make combos or whatever, but just how they look like). I think dragons looked way too basic, but some MAIN bosses, looked interesting enough. I almost got this anime vibe, that very first boss already feels like final boss, but actually there's countless of other bosses after him, who are ever stronger, bigger, etc. Sadly that wasn't enough for me, i wanted this game to be way more complex than just boss killing simulator, i wanted it to be deeper, i wanted it to be actually INTERESTING. I can tolerated difficult bosses, if game itself is interesting enough for me, to want to keep going. But this game doesn't have that. It doesn't have that ""Resident Evil 4"" (2005) vibe where there will be cool story moments after this epic boss fight, etc. There's none of that. If you beat the two bosses in castle, all you get is just another big swamp area full of random generic monsters for you to fight with. Too me that's so boring, so basic and so empty that i just didn't care anymore. In the end of the day, i will never play this game again, i didn't refund, i simply uninstalled it and went back to play some actually great games to get rid of that ""empty, meaningless"" feeling that Elden Ring left in me. I will never talk about this game again with anyone. I will never recommend this game to anyone and i will try to ignore that it ever existed, because it was that bland.",2,2022-03-02,PLAYSTATION 5

See below: Those reviews seems to be financed by marketing. The game is fantastic don't get me wrong. It doesn't have a proper story, but who expects a story from these kind of games. It's more about the exploration/fighting. I love it, and it's basically DS4 in an open world filled with interesting things. Now that I mentioned the best part about it, here is what's wrong with this game. The game has TECHNICAL ISSUES that no one is talking about. I lost 6 hours (10 level worth) on my PS5 yesterday because it's saving system is broken. It literally DOES NOT SAVE, it does not even give you a warning, nothing. You just don't know it. When you try to quit the game, then close it (like developers recommended), and then suddenly it crashes your ps5 and turns it off, just be sure that how many hours you have put in it that specific walk through, did not count one bit. It's literally a waste of time. I don't get how reviewers are overlooking this serious matter. I will never trust any critic's review on this website",2,2022-03-02,PLAYSTATION 5
Stintacus,"Spent 3 hours playing the night I got it on ps4, multiple auto saves at bonfires, then i manually exited and saved game, woke up the next day back at 10 minutes into the game & level 10 again, played another 7 hours that day, saved it all properly, went to go back on it a few hours later & the game hadn’t saved again, the game is unplayable without being able to save",1,2022-03-02,PLAYSTATION 5

Jakeyg,Most overated game I've ever. Combat is boring and repetitive. The graphics just are not up to par with other games now days. There isn't much of a story at all and the open world still left me with something more to be desired. It's certainly a game but I wouldn't call it a good one much less best of all time.,1,2022-03-02,PLAYSTATION 5

anonymity,"The hype wasn’t invented it was earned, the salty low scores are hilarious. Like the other souls games though, these games aren’t for everyone and I don’t think Elden Ring is different really, It’s more accessible yes but a lot of people still won’t be able to beat it. If you couldn’t beat a souls game before this don’t get it. If you’re on the fence read all the negative user scores and give it a try. It will put into perspective how hyperbolic, bitter, and childish their “critiques” are.",10,2022-03-02,PLAYSTATION 5

eojlc,"The critics have got this one wrong. Elden Ring has suffered from timing. This was a game we needed during the pandemic not after, and a game that needed to be released before Sekiro – from which its gameplay is a downgrade; before the Demon’s Souls remake – from which the graphics are a downgrade; and far closer to Breath of the Wild - which it hasn’t fully understood desperate liberal plagiarism. Elden Ring, and it is disappointing to write this, feels much more like a large-scale fan-made Dark Souls 3 mod for Breath of the Wild than it does the next artistic offering from Miyazaki & co. It is difficult to pinpoint what, if anything, is actually new. The gameplay is a mirror image of Dark Souls 3 save for the guard counter, which is an easy and accessible miniest of mini-game versions of Sekiro’s poise system. The open world style of legacy dungeons and procedural dungeons is lifted straight from BotW - if only the crucial beauty of allowing the player to traverse anything and everything were lifted too, there’s nothing elegant about watching your avatar hop clumsily around a slightly too lumpy rock. Those reviewers calling this a new benchmark for open-world games can’t have played The Witcher 3 or Breath of the Wild. Sekiro proved that unique combat systems can not only exist but thrive within the broader souls-like formula. With Elden Ring, From have returned to the tried, tested, and frankly hackneyed. After the three-year wait one can’t help but be a little disappointed not to be enjoying the next step in the evolution of souls-like combat. While Link’s ability to climb or Wolf’s grappling rope are sorely missed when roaming Elden Ring’s open world, it is a deeper Dark Souls mechanic which most noticeably grates: loot. Almost every weapon you pick up in Elden Ring will be worse than what you currently have equipped because you’ve likely been upgrading that as soon as you possibly can to take on some of the extraordinarily difficult bosses. Imagine if, rather than repeatedly travelling back to vendors to sell most of what you pick up to keep upgrading your Uchigatana, you simply kept finding better Uchigatanas, or better yet a variety weapons that you could pick up and start slaying with. Wouldn’t this make slaying mobs in the wilderness more enticing? It frustrates to find an exciting bit of gear but feel that using it will **** your progress in the game as enemies will now die in four hits rather than three. A defence of this system may be that one is intended to replay the game using different builds. However, there is far too much repetitive travelling for this to be as limitlessly replayable as the Dark Souls series or Bloodborne. Perhaps Miyazaki has given birth to the golden cow of the souls-like and now needs to stop milking it. While Sekiro was a masterpiece that proved impenetrable for too many, Elden Ring is your favourite band selling out with a pop song that more people can enjoy but may well disgust a good chunk of the fanbase. The commercial angle is confirmed by the comically apparent involvement of G.R.R Martin, whose presence is mysteriously eclipsed by his absence. Elden Ring isn’t From’s best game, and it may well be their worst. What it is, however, is fresh souls-like content, which is always fun for as long as it lasts. After a long string of 9 out of 10s, Elden Ring unfortunately feels like a 7.",7,2022-03-02,PLAYSTATION 5

I was a huge fan of DS3 and this game just feels like The best of the best of all the souls games.

RedReVenge,"I give it a 9, but so many 0s... Need to balance out the trolls. 40 hours in!!!! I'm not a souls player. First Souls game was PS5 Demon souls! This is the best RPG I've played since Skyrim. Do yourself a favor and give it a play. The game can be made as difficult or as easy as you'd like. Want it harder? Go at bosses alone. Want it easier? Go find golden seeds and acquire more / stronger potions before encountering the first boss + bring in a coop and use summons (very easy to acquire). Once you figure out the game, you can vs the first boss with at least 5 potions at level +2. Have encountered 1-2 bugs, Nothing game breaking. The game has a great sense of discovery. I've made 3 accounts and have found new stuff in each account scouring over the same early region. There is so much to do and so many unique items to find. I get excited when I walk up to a new location and wondering what enemies await me? What rewards can I receive here? Can I find a new ally? Coop is really smooth. Wish you didn't need to collect an item everytime someone joins you, but it's a souls game... Only REAL complaint: Graphics do seem out of date and textures tend to fade in and out sometimes. This doesn't bother me because I care more about gameplay and how it feels rather than the ""best possible"" graphics. My ""second"" complaint. It would be nice if there was a journal that kept track of current quest lines that you've encountered. It doesn't have to tell you where to go to continue the quest, but at least something that reminds you that you had a quest ongoing. This isn't a complaint, but makes things a bit easier when trying to complete quest lines.",10,2022-03-02,PLAYSTATION 5

Gracenn7,"As someone who never picked up a souls game. Who always plays games on normal or easy, this game shouldn't appeal to me at all . However from the moment I stepped into this vast world and fought my first enemy I absolutely couldn't put it down. Technical issues aside the world is beautiful , engrossing and begging for exploration. Not using any guides just figuring out the risk vs reward gameplay loop of fighting that higher level boss to get just a few more souls to level up . I'm hooked and love it. Being this is my first souls game I can see why maybe some veterans of the series may feel that at this point no much has changed and this game doesn't bring enough change they expected. But for someone new to the series this is an amazing , challenging world that must be played through . This is my game of the year so far.",10,2022-03-02,PLAYSTATION 5

Vyce_PA,"This game exceeded my expectations. The open world is much bigger and richer than I could have expected. Exploring is as satisfying as the combat is challenging. This game keeps the challenge of Dark Souls that I became to love while providing a really vast and interesting world to explore. The already well tuned combat system got even richer with this installment. I have to add that the difficulty is higher than I expected as well. I feared it would become an easy cakewalk, but was happily surprised that the iconic challenge of Dark Souls games remained for this installment as well. The only downside I see is that solo hosts have to opt-into PvP which gives you a very hard time as a new invader. It should not come as a surprise that the graphics are good, but the focus lies on the game play. I personally really like the environments and stood in awe more than once, but the visuals are obviously not as good as Demon's Souls or other graphic focused current gen games. Overall a very good game due to the diverse combat system and vast and interesting open world.",10,2022-03-02,PLAYSTATION 5
LameOpportunist,"This game is great. It is the best game made by the developer From Software so far. The open world is huge. The environment are beautiful and well rendered. The atmosphere and the music are godly level. For the first time we have a map, which on top is gorgeous. However this is a from Software game to its core. Difficult, sometimes unfair, story is there but you need to look for it. It is just not a game for everyone. I get the feeling that many people were expecting an assassins' creed or Horizon Zero down type of experience, and feel tricked because this is not the game they wanted. The criticism is fair and valid but should not be a reason to review bond and game that is very good. We can argue how much but anywhere from 8 to 9.5 seems fair to me.",9,2022-03-02,PLAYSTATION 5

ComfyChriis,"Is Elden Ring ""just"" an open world Dark Souls? Yes. First lets talk about the dungeons and castles, generally speaking the close quarter areas. They are what you would expect from a like, many different paths to choose with many different and difficult enemies inside. Just perfection. Then we have the open world. The open world is OK. It is not bad but also not great either. You have some roaming enemies, some bigger and badder than others. The open world might throw some souls players off because they are not used to so much freedom. But this is the point that makes Elden Ring good. You WANT to see what is behind that corner, what is inside that cave, what is over there, the freedom From Software has given is amazing. Concluding: Elden Ring is a good game.

However this game has been hyped all over the internet as more approachable than a typical From game, and has the added draw of having a “story” “written” by GRRM. There is nothing accessible or intriguing about this game. Having played other soulslike games only makes the predictable opening and tedious slog of looping through areas again and again feel tired and stale . The combat is much worse and less responsive than in other From games I played. And I felt no sense of wonder or excitement from exploration. As for the story, after a few hours in, I really was unable to discern what GRRM had brought the table. There was nothing worth staying in this world for. I just deleted the game.

LuckySevens,"VERDICT: As someone who's beaten every FromSoftware Soulsborne game enough times for it to seem like it's my full time job, I can say with certainty that Elden Ring is the best game they've made in the genre and arguably the best game ever made. I'm currently 50 hours in with an incredible amount of content cleared and tons more yet to be explored. It's genuinely mind blowing how a game of this magnitude, polish, and replay-ability was released only 3 years after FromSoftware's last game (Sekiro) which was also incredible. In an age of talentless TripleA developers pumping out unfinished and uninspired garbage year after year for upwards of $70 USD just for the standard copy, Elden Ring takes me back to the good ole days of paying $60 for a complete experience that does not need updates and will satisfy me for years to come. Granted every FromSoftware game since Demons Souls has been more than worth the price of admission, but this one is on a whole other level. This game has an enormous world that's never boring to explore, a staggering 80+ bosses, limitless build options, and near infinite replay value. Not to mention it has some of the coolest weapons, bosses, and most beautiful locations I've ever seen in a game. Elden Ring easily deserves the highest praise it can get with a 10/10 score from me and it sets a new bar for this genre and gaming in general that at this point only FromSoftware can top. The rest of the industry needs to take notice. This is how you make a game for the fans and not for the money. WHAT IS ELDEN RING? Elden Ring is a new game and new universe created by FromSoftware in association with George R.R Martin. It is the next evolution in FromSoftware's ""souls"" genre that they started way back with Demons Souls in 2009 on the PS3. It takes that classic souls formula of deep RPG elements, punishing stamina based combat that requires timing and patience to master, losing your level up currency upon death (in this case runes) and needing to retrieve them before dying again and losing them forever, difficult boss battles, bonfire checkpoints (they're called sites of grace in Elden Ring) that allow you to fill up on your healing and mana while simultaneously respawning the enemies, and it puts all these mechanics on an open world scale that is absolutely enormous. In order to explore the world at a decent pace you're given a horse soon after completing the tutorial area. This changes the way you play the game in many ways since fighting while on the horse is a more than viable option in a lot of scenarios even in it does take some getting used to. Do keep in mind though that there are some areas in which you can't use the horse, but that's ok because it's typically in areas that you wouldn't want to use it anyways. Elden Ring also has countless builds, weapons, armor, and abilities that allow you to play the game in so many ways that you probably won't get to use everything for a very long time which makes it great for replay value. One final thing to note about this game as well as the other games in the souls genre is that they are not easy in the beginning. These games are notorious for their difficulty which is true to an extent. If you are unwilling to learn from your mistakes and adapt then this game will probably be too much for you to handle. It will test your patience and awareness early on and if you are willing to get better, it will only be a matter of time before you're taking down the baddest of bosses and wondering why you ever thought things were difficult in the first place. I will have a section at the bottom that will include ways to get better if you're struggling so be sure to read that. IN RESPONSE TO NEGATIVE REVIEWS AND FRUSTRATED PLAYERS: I felt like making this section in hopes that new players and people who are giving up on the game early can read this. Elden Ring as well as the other games in the souls genre are not unfair, they are not impossible, and they can absolutely be mastered to a point where it's not even a challenge anymore. I see a lot of people just get mad, quit, and either stop playing entirely or write a negative review saying the game is bad when in reality it was their own fault. They were either unwilling to learn from their mistakes or the game is just not for them. Neither of which make the game bad. Here is some general advice for those of you are struggling and find the game to be too difficult: 1. Learn an enemies moveset before going all out on attacks. If you know when an enemy's attacks/combo ends, you know when to get a free hit. 2. Don't be greedy. Always try to get at least one-two hits in and then wait for the enemies attacks to finish. 3. Summon help if you need it. You can either summon NPCs for certain fights, spirit ashes which let you fight with NPC mobs of your choosing, or real players. 4. Farm runes for levels. This isn't the fun way, but every bit of extra damage helps.",10,2022-03-02,PLAYSTATION 5

Exploration is amazing and the sense of accomplishemnt of finding hidden parts and beating so many differnet bosses is great! Game has a subtle way guiding your way if you find yourself lost.

Xedmed,"After playing nearly 70hrs of this game I've had to downgrade my 10/10 **** was good for 40hrs. Handled like Darksouls, few nice mechanics, nice world. The last 30 have been like pulling teeth. The game is cheap. At over level 100 I'm getting lambasted for stupid reasons. Bosses just instakill you as you walk in. I've found the same bosses at least 4 times and still have another few instances of the same fights to go. The controls often just do nothing when buttons are pressed. And while I'd love to stop I need to see the end as I've spent so much time on this. Miyazaki. Stick to 30-40 hr games and don't pad your next one as badly as this. Bit of Balance too, particularly near the end would also be nice. It gets 4, 1 for each of the first 10hrs of the game I enjoyed.",4,2022-03-02,PLAYSTATION 5

Gothmog94,Its ok but that's all it really is. Its DS3 but with more build customization basically. So if you just want the same old Dark Souls but more content you'll be satisfied. But it isn't nearly as innovative as the press and streamers have made it out to be. Cons Combat hasn't taken any steps forward its still L1 Spam or R1 spam no real combos or varied movesets like Nioh has for example. Enviromental collision/obstacles is terrible with enemies reaching through whole walls and pillars as it always has been. Frames drop pretty consitently during combat even on framerate mode. But hopefully that'll be a simple patch here soon. Not enough boss variety to fill the open world. They use many of the bosses 4 or more times throughout a single playthrough. With one of them being Asylum Demon from DS1. I mean come on we already had to fight him 3 times in that one 11 years ago now another 4 in this game?! Poise still ****. I don't want broken DS1 poise where everyone havels but there really is no point in heavy armor if even hits that do almost no damage can stagger/stun lock. Pros Atmosphere is the best its been for a souls game. Actually a decent number of NPCs to meet and have minor roles/quests with The new customizable flask is probably the best part/innovation. Map & fast travel is an extreme improvement but I can't give them major credit for something that's been a feature in other games since 2005 lol.

So many open world games have huge, yet sparsely populated, maps. Elden ring places another enemy, another interesting ruin, another demanding dungeon around every corner. It’s all the exciting exploration of this generations best open world titles paired with the punishing yet oh so satisfying Souls combat, and even that has been enhanced and perfected here.",10,2022-03-01,PLAYSTATION 5
VOID-jager,"Elden ring might be the most beautiful and detailed game world I've ever seen. Everytime I thought I saw all it has to offer I tuned a corner or went down a long elevator to a whole new area spanning out into the distance that I had no idea was even there. You can tell the world is hand crafted and not procedurally assisted by a computer program. Every little thing seems to have it's place and you don't see a lot of repeating assets or structures, everything was designed and put in place with a specific intention. It's the same amazing quality with the open world encounters, they all feel unique and each one feels new, not like most open worlds that have their world filled to the brim with cut n paste instances of the same 5 or 6 mission types and a map filled with quest icons leaving nothing as a surprise as to where and what you'll find. Fromsoftware deserves praise of the highest order for this masterpiece, I've never played anything quite like it. It's a souls fans dream come true the way this game was made, secrets everywhere that most people will miss and never even know was there without looking up a guide. Tons of enemy types, hugely varied environments that manage to blend perfectly, tons of bosses and mini bosses, super addictive progression mechanics like usual for them, it's a challenging game that doesn't hold your hand. It makes you earn your progress and earn secrets, it doesn't just hand it to you with a checklist of chores to do that takes you there. I dont use this word lightly but this game IS a masterpiece . Nothing is perfect but this is as close to perfection that I've seen in my 3+ decades of gaming and at this point it's probably the all around best game Ive ever played. Btw, FromSoftware, you guys are f Gods and all developers should model their games after yours. New gamers, If you want your hand held through everything, do not buy this, but if you want a rewarding experience that may be tough and frustrating at first but if you stick with it you will be rewarded far more than you can imagine and understand why the hype from the cult fanbase is so rapid and this dev is becoming so popular and loved. Like in the matrix, no one can be told what souls fandom is, you have to see it for yourself and it must be experienced to understand. If you make it through any of their games you'll likely be a convert for life and know why no one wants big shanges to cator to a wider audience. If I can play these games anyone can.",10,2022-03-01,PLAYSTATION 5
JaredLeeJardine,I bought two copies of this game so I could play co-op with my sons. It has been fantastic. I've played past Dark Souls games and they often ended in frustration when you got sick in a particular difficult boss. The open world is a great fit that allows you to do other things when you are stuck and continue to make progress and come back when you are ready. There are some clunky things about the co-op but it is SO much better than earlier Souls games and with the sites of grace being more prolific it is much easier to coordinate and join each other. I love being able to use the horse to get around the world so much faster. While the mounted combat feels solid and well thought out rather than an after thought. There are several improvements that just make the game work better. Even the summon system is a great way of helping a solo player compete in some of the harrier areas. It is also a visual masterpiece. I've caught myself pausing several times to just take in the scenery and appreciate the artistry that is everywhere in the game.,10,2022-03-01,PLAYSTATION 5

But after some time, it feels lonely and repetitive, and you don't know where to go. And the cherry on top, the same cat boss three times in three different dungeons. Come on from-software have some creativity in different bosses: very confusing upgrade mechanics and no information about the recommended level to defeat an enemy or boss.

Anyone familiar with a From Software game will find many of their signature staples in abundance, for better or worse, but mostly for the better. They have tried to trim the most annoying excesses while maintaining a high level of challenge for those who wish to seek that out. Going into too much detail would spoil things, but suffice it to say those of us already deep into this game are still only scratching the surface.

RRrpgManiax,"I have never played any of the Souls games before, but being a connoisseur of RPGs and hearing of this supposedly legendary RPG series I felt it was time I finally bit the bullet. I figured with Martin penning the game's story it would be rather grand involving political intrigue and riveting tales of man's inner folly. Having grown up on D&D and CRPGs I expected to have a fair idea of what I was getting into. Much to my surprise, I found a vast open world filled with nothing to do. I created my character to wander around some lifeless void. Oh, it looks rather grand the art direction is quite phenomenal though the textures muddied and the game is plagued with pop-ins as well. I am able to forgive the occasional jank for a good and true RPG. I however did not find one in this game. I'm not sure what constitutes for an RPG these days amongst the general public, but generally it's a game with roleplaying options of which this game seems to have none other than building your character's stats and skills. All problems are solved through this game's languid, ponderous, and clunky combat. No non-combat or social options in this supposed RPG. The exploration as as dull and lifeless as the world in which it inhabits. Some scant crafting materials to create some mediocre items with minimal stat gains. Undoubtedly the usual carrot and the stick seen in the MMO sphere influenced this trash itemization. The dungeons were quite interesting and a more linear experience and I killed Margit after ten or twelve tries. The game's molasses combat was made even more frustrating due to the various technical issues that plague this supposed RPG (Hint it's not an RPG it's just combat pornography) Your character's hitboxes are far too large causing the enemies to strike you frequently when you're clearly outside of their swing radius. There's also numerous frame rate drops making the game's sole feature of combat extremely difficult since the technical execution of the developers lack of talent is holding you back further than the difficulty of the game is. All in all this game is not an RPG, there are no roleplaying options. It's just combat pornography for the youth's violent **** sadist rituals. If you have any class avoid this buggy mess like the plague it is and cast it into the fire! I for one got a full refund from my local gamestore, but I hope to save others the expense. We all know this game doesn't deserve a perfect score.

BettyBouncer,"Elden Ring is the best game I have played in at least ten years, maybe ever. Gameplay wise it is exactly what I expected and wished for. It is the combination of every good gameplay aspect of earlier souls games. You can roam freely in an open world in which every region feels and looks immensly different from the other regions. These regions are filled with content as well. I have come back to earlier regions and almost always found a new dungeon or a new npc. While not every small corner in this world is filled with items or general secrets, you still get rewarded for exploration, but in a slightly broader scale than in the earlier From Software titles. Now performance: This game is currently being review bombed by people for multiple reasons. Mostly the performance on PC. It is only day 3 so I am certain that these issues will be fixed soon, especially with a company like From Software, who is always trying to listen to the community. Nevertheless, these issues do not suddenly turn this beautifully breathtaking game to a 0 points. Do not listen to these people.

Eienkei,"Most overhyped & overrated game of all time! Have you played any Souls games? It's the exact same thing. The game cheats & unnecessarily frustrates you; there's no story, as usual, so not sure what George R R Martin has done in this collaboration. It all depends on repeating the same sequences and building muscle memory, but you know what I would do instead if I had so much time? I would learn to play an instrument and leverage muscle memory for something useful, not this nonsense! Graphics are dated, the gameplay is the same nonsense from 15 years ago and it's buggy as hell! If Cyberpunk had to be punished, how on earth this game is getting away with it?",0,2022-03-01,PLAYSTATION 5
Gimp,Absolutely addicted to this game. This en captures the definition of adventure. The discovery of events supports that. And the action to land ratio is near perfect. Now some people say it is hard to know where to go in comparison to previous souls games. Which imo this game does not lack in that aspect. This game tells you where to go in many ways. For instance npc’s tell you critical information. If you for some reason don’t talk to npc’s ever. Then the sites of grace will tell you where to go on the map. This game’s art design is stunning. The overall game is the best game I’ve ever played.,10,2022-03-01,PLAYSTATION 5

ManicSkoobs,"First off, I just wanted to start off by saying the people who claim the graphics in this game are bad don’t know what art style is I guess. Although there are most definitely hiccups as far as pop in goes, the game looks absolutely stunning. The biggest addition that really makes this game easier to enjoy is how charitable from soft is with checkpoints this time around. The most time it’s taken me to run back to a boss is about 30 seconds and those instances are few and far between which makes dying to hard bosses way less frustrating and tedious. All things said, Elden ring is an amalgamation of all from soft games so far thrown into an open world which feels as dense as it is wide.",10,2022-03-01,PLAYSTATION 5
JoeDerbyshire,THIS IS THE BEST GAME I HAVE EVER PLAYED! I would suggest not comparing it to other open world games as it creates a very different feeling from most if not all open world games.

Corporate_Goon,"I'm 30 hours into the game and it is fantastic. It is challenging, yes, but Elden Ring gives you more options than previous FromSoft games for mitigating that difficulty - from just going off and exploring another part of the world until you feel ready to tackle the challenge, to summoning 'spirits' that aid you in difficult fights. The world is gorgeous, the enemies are well-designed, there are tons of great weapons and spells to play with, and when you reach a 'dungeon' area, it is laid out like the best classic Souls locations. The second dungeon area, (the Academy) plays like a perfect melding of Yharnam from Bloodborne and Irythil from Dark Souls 3. There are a few *minor* technical problems with the PC version on launch. People giving this game 0 out of 10 because it doesn't support ultrawide monitors are just being ridiculous. There's a bit of minor frame stuttering when the game loads new assets, but this only happens occasionally and never during combat encounters, and i've encountered a few minor bugs, but none were game-breaking and I expect all to be ironed out in patches within the next month or so. I'm 30 hours in and I feel like I'm maybe 1/3 of the way through the game. It's breathtaking in scope and incredibly fun to play. I'm giving it a 9 rather than a 10 because the open world does sometimes feel a bit less unique than previous From games - it is definitely influenced by BOTW and Skyrim - and because of those minor technical hiccups. But absolutely fantastic game and a must-play.",9,2022-03-01,PLAYSTATION 5

RowanBlack,"Very pretty but after a while you feel the world is silent and alone, often feeling like a fantasy MMO with no other people playing. It's not that the game is bad just the world while surprising at times is often very quiet. It also seems to be a large map of ""lets see what's over there and can I kill it?"" I'm not sure what exactly is says about a game that the community is more concerned with finding leveling exploit spots than discussing the game it's self. If you like a constant string of challenging combat this will be for you. Everyone else? It's okay to explorers their is a lot to see.

I really liked DS1 and 3, but in this game everything seems random and generic. There are hardly any real goals to achieve,you are just wandering around without sense and reason, waiting for the next enemy horde to slaughter.

You have to literally write it down in a journal to reference , I know the excuse is that it’s for pure immersion purpose, but honestly come on, that’s rediculous. You can’t pause the game either.

rovermhc,"Gameplay...Dark Souls at it's best. If you love Dark Souls, then this is hands down a W. Atmosphere and world design is superg, art design is great, horse combat actually kinda fun, combat engaging and challenging. 60 hours and it's like the game that keeps on giving. Cons: lazy cut and paste assets, mechanics such as jumping could be improved with a climbing mechanic, combat is a bit samey from other souls game, albeit more refined. For all it's success, I find it disappointing that From can't improve on their graphics. Clippings, outdated animations and assets, half-ass textures, , AI can be nonexistent at times. All that said, Dark Souls blood runs deep and if you're a fan, then it's easily the masterpiece we've been waiting for. I really hope scores less than a 7 gets removed. Even not a fan, this game deserves nothing less than a 7 for it's size, scope, breathtaking fantasy vision, replayability and sooo many hidden gems. Fantastic game!",10,2022-03-01,PLAYSTATION 5
TankatheGreat,"Ignore all of these terribly made negative reviews youre seeing. This game is a masterpiece and I highly suspect the majority of them are from people who have struggled to get past the first boss alone and have been stuck wandering the beginning areas of the game. The world of Elden Ring is expansive and lively, from countless enemies around almost every corner to 83 bosses in total, 77 of which are completely unique from one another, to the huge amount of NPC’s both hidden and in plain view for you to interact with. Elden Ring is the totality of everything From Soft has learned over the decades of making the Soulsborne games and put them all together for both veterans of the series and newcomers to enjoy. This game however is not for the faint of heart, you will grow frustrated with bosses or enemies at points, that’s a staple of any Soulsborne game and that’s what brings so much enjoyment out of it when you finally overcome that boss you spent an extended amount of time on, just to turn around and get knocked back down by the next area of enemies or bosses. It’s a rollercoaster ride of pain and excitement all at once. That’s not even going into depth on the sheer amount of lore and Easter eggs that are hidden in the game. My only knock is that sure there are some technical issues here and there and the graphics aren’t the best we’ve ever seen but the issues are nothing patches to the game can’t fix, many of these issues are already being looked into by From Software as well. Moral of the review is that this game is worth every single penny spent on it and will bring you hours, days and possibly even weeks of enjoyment, pain, excitement and frustration in all of the right ways on just your first play through alone.",9,2022-03-01,PLAYSTATION 5
Jotte,"This is quite Literally the best game I have ever played. The open world is sprawling with life, every book and cranny is filled with something cool to Find. The mini-dungeons are a little same-y But not to an extent i found detrimental to the games overall enjoyment. The minibosses, although sometimes recycled added a lot of enjoyment, and sometimes Even more challenge than major bosses. You can Tell every area apart just from looking at a screenshot, the color schemes are different and varied to separate them. The orange/yellow altus to the blue liurnia, the reds of caelid. The performance was mostly 55+ fps, worst drops happening in altus to maybe 45. A few small fps drops here and There Dont deter from my enjoyment either. Frames never dropped during bosses either. The enemy variety is frankly impressive, say compared to breath of the wild(Another great Open world game). The jump button allows for a verticality in fromsofts world design and torrent helps with traversing huge swathes of land while taking in the scenery. This game is truly the first time Ive experienced ”If You can see it You can go There”. The bosses are all a treat. Margit is a great first boss, teaching players that This game Isnt going to go easy on you. I can genuinely say that there isn’t a single bad boss, compare it to say, Dark souls 2 where basically every boss except maybe knight alonne is pretty bad and not memorable at all. The ashes of war is one of the best new additions to elden ring. The freedom it gives is a great addition to increase build variety. Mash all of This together and You get one of the best games of all time. I genuinely cant Think of any issues other than performance at some points.",10,2022-03-01,PLAYSTATION 5

El principal problema que le veo es que literalmente te sueltan en un mundo en el que no tienes ni historia, ni un objetivo ni absolutamente nada, te pones a explorar mientras te metes en zonas que no debes y mueres mueres y mueres, hasta que de casualidad encuentras el camino hacia un boss secundario. Llevo 15h soy nivel 50 y he matado 2 bosses principales, derrepente voy a un sitio y me encuentro con el boss final, casi desinstalo el juego. La otra pega a comentar es el diseño del mundo, basicamente han hecho copia pega en el 90% de zonas del mapa, mismos animales, mismos enemigos, misma ambientación, excepto en unos muy concretos.

TrentDarko,"A very big adventure to become the Elden Lord. I came into this game very new to FromSoftware games and at first, It was very hard and I almost quit. After playing for about ten more hours I got used to it and now it is addicted. This game is very challenging and might take gamers that are not used to these types of games much longer to become the Elden Lord. I find myself dying and recollecting my ruins so much doing each playthrough. I think even if you're not great at these games that you might find something to enjoy about it. For me, collecting ruins and leveling up until I am strong enough to beat a boss is pretty fun. The graphics for this game is very beautiful. The framerate is very good in performance mode with some dips. It really feels like I am in a dark and twisted world. Overall, I think that this is the most fun I've had with a game in forever. I highly recommend it.",10,2022-03-01,PLAYSTATION 5
BrightAbyss,"This is what happens when a Fromsoftware game goes mainstream, it gets review bombed. This is probably the most mainstream Fromsoft game to date, as I have many friends who have messaged me about the game who normally don't even consider these types of games. That's great, because I love seeing this community grow and many more people will be drawn into these games because of Elden Ring, but I don't think some people really understand what they are signing up for. I have about 40 hours into the game, and I can say that if you are a Fromsoft fan, this will be heaven. World is engaging and full of secrets, progression and builds feel personalized and unique, and the bosses are top tier quality. I personally have not experienced framerate drops, but I know that it is an issue for some players so keep that in mind. Everything about the game feels nearly perfect. The combat is fun, the world is engaging, and I've had a great time playing with some of my newer friends just messing around in The Lands Between. The only con (minor) I have of the game is the size of it can get confusing, which tbh is nothing new for a Fromsoft game, but because of Elden Ring's sheer size, at times I can go like an hour not finding anything and have to resort to a guide to figure out where to go. Overall this game is fantastic and deserves all of the praise (unless you are experiencing technical issues but those will be fixed). The main reason for the review bombs are new players coming into the game expecting it to be something like GTA with swords. It's not, it's a Fromsoft game. Stop crying about the first boss being too difficult and actually try to learn the fight. The first Fromsoft game you play will be your hardest, but thanks to how popular Elden Ring is, there will be more than enough people ready to help you on your journey. Trust me, if you are persistent enough, you will overcome the challenges of this game and feel like a badass, but hey if this style of game isn't for you, then it isn't for you. No harm done.

Santaslerg,"Most of the negative reviews have nothing to do with the actual gameplay or story. I understand frustration with frame drops and technical issues, but I've seen plenty of people giving the game a 10 even with experiencing the same issues. This game is absolutely phenomenal. As someone who has played and beaten most of the souls games multiple times, this is a dream come true. An open world dark souls just makes so much sense. Every game rewarded exploring, and this does that times a million. A vast and punishing world, where if you're getting stomped by a boss for a few hours, you can leave and explore a new area to gain more runes and level your character/weapons. And on the way you might find a new weapon, or armor set. Maybe a golden seed or sacred tear to upgrade your flasks. Then you can go back and beat the boss. In all the other souls games, you'd have to farm souls for hours, but this makes it possible to not do that, while it is still available if you want too. People are frustrated with boss mechanics and timing, but I've actually enjoyed overcoming some of this. They definitely changed some of the timing in comparison to ds1 through 3. I've noticed some of the bosses have crazy long swings that are at first hard to navigate around when used to the quick movements of most of the previous game bosses. I like that they made it more accessible in some ways for new players, but made it even harder in other ways for souls veterans. At about half way through the game, I can easily say this is up there for the best from software game, and one of the best open world games of all time. Oh and there's a mount, enough said 10/10",10,2022-03-01,PLAYSTATION 5
vienne,"This is basically Dark Souls 3 in an open world. All mechanics are the same, i.e. outdated. Sekiro was a good step forward: deflections, ""hesitation is defeat"" and so on - great game, 9-10/10. People had high expectation, Mr. Miyazaki said that ER gotta show good graphics to keep up with Demon's Souls remaster, and he delivered. But graphics and level design are everything this game has to offer, sadly. I also suspect that story will unfold in an unexpected and exciting way. But it's hard to just sit there and play when gameplay is exactly what you've experienced 6 years ago. Speaking of open world - it simply doesn't work. It's empty, 95% of it is just decoration. It's okay with me, as I said - level design (emphasis on ""design"") is good. But you find yourself riding a horse 90% of the time trying to explore a world that has little to offer - some loot, various mobs and occasional NPCs, mostly merchants. There are a lot of ""bonfires"" that connect together a dull emptiness of the game world. I rate it 5/10 for labor being done properly but without any imagination regarding game design. Horse is overpowered. Just ride in circles + L1/R1",5,2022-03-01,PLAYSTATION 5

From the little time I have spent attempting to play a Souls game in the past, Elden Ring feels pretty much the same. The odd, washed out and dated looking graphics, the little messages players leave behind, the difficulty of the enemies; it is all there. And I will try some more, just as I did with Dark Souls, 1, 2, 3 and Bloodborne, but I am fairly confident I absolutely hate it. Elden Ring mechanics and visuals are like an early PS4 game.

Evernoth,"After playing 50 hours, I can say that i still have a lot to discover, the gameplay is really solid with a lot of different ways to confront any situation, the story it's such a complex drama with a lot of political, lovecraftean and magical aspects, you can feel the tension between all the many different npcs, everyone is trying to use you, or taking adventage of the situation to reach their own goals, they feel really alive, and at the end you'll have to take a decission, very few games can manage to create that feeling of weight on your decissions, now, all that is complemented with a brilliant world building, the lore is really deep, and it truly makes you question some aspects you see, just to discover later than things aren't like they seemed at the beginning, that there's more dept into it, about the audiovisual aspect, it's excellent, some people may complain that there isn't 16k textures, that demon's souls remake looks better, would have been better if it was done on unreal and stuff, can't blame them, but all that is eclipsed by the art direction, the game has an unique asmoshpere, it's truly beautiful, the draw distance is huge, and everything you see, you can go there, and truly, the map is **** big, and all that, done without loosing the art direction quality, there's a place that you get teleported after ""x"" chest, and when you see it, it's just beautiful, the music causes so many feelings, from the majestuosity, to the melancholy of the place, the scale of everything, makes you feel that your character is in a odissey, soemthing to take note off, is that Elden Ring is a way different than any other from game to date, it's a dying world but, it's a way more alive than any soulsborne to date, and the feeling you get through playing makes you feel heroic, rather than sad or melancholic, the music helps a lot on that, there has been a really clear evoltion on how they composed the music, it works to give you that feeling of heroism, to defeath your enemies and become the legendary Elden Lord that everyone has told you to become, this game will be very subjective for a lot of people, in summary, the game is amazing and causes a lot of feelings on the player while more this one gets involved into the story and the world itself, if your major complain is just the graphics, then you should go for any other deadworld game with beautiful 3d models with not personality, with hundred of things telling you to pick this or this, just being guided like a sheep, and i don't blame them, but imo, the game is a masterpiece, has been years since i've seen such an alive world, with so many content, that gives you so many freedom, and with such a rich story and such a beautiful world writing, as videogames developer, is something that I would aspire to reach. About the preformance, IMO, any problem is eclipsed by what i said before. It shouldn't be the standart but fromsoftwer managed to get a special place on my heart, and i'm sure that a lot of other souls players will feel the same, how From changed their lives in some way, it's something that not any company can do.",10,2022-03-01,PLAYSTATION 5

Absolutely no evolution from the first Souls game in terms of gameplay and mechanics. The most annoying part is that bosses and mini-bosses don't react to your actions whatsoever. They just do not care what you are doing. They got hit? Who cares? You blocked their attack? Nothing. It's like you don't even exist to them, so you are just playing with yourself really.

robinhoodOO7,"Subjectively, I understand how Elden Ring can be ****'s a punishing Soulsborne game that can beat players into the ground. It's a game that's simply not for every gamer and I question just how much more ""accessible"" it really is. Objectively, Elden Ring is the pinnacle of gaming and possibly one of the top 5 open world games ever made. No, there aren't vast villages and towns with shops to explore littered throughout the world. Instead, there are hidden NPC's, bosses, dungeons, enemy encampments, mines, abandoned churches, numerous areas, numerous secrets, etc. It's very different from your ordinary open world fantasy game, but done in the best ways possible. Ultimately, it's hard to find a ""weak point"" with Elden Ring, other than to say it won't appeal to many gamers. I have not, for example experienced any of the technical issues, and everything else (as stated by other reviews) is perfect. Gameplay is amazing and hitboxes are fixed. Dungeons and Legacy Dungeons are brilliantly done. The open world is varied and begs to be explored. Bosses are difficult, but co-op is back and better than ever. Customization is nigh infinite.

Too many newcomers to the souls series going in expecting breath of the wild, getting killed over and over and deciding to review bomb the game because they're not capable of putting in the effort to find the payout. It's a bummer, honestly. I'm loving it, and am extremely satisfied, especially given the hype.",10,2022-03-01,PLAYSTATION 5
Patmoamagaman11,"Buddy told me to check this game out I used to play some action games back on the PS2. Not really my jam these days, but I figured what they hell why not. Let me tell you this is no God of War. Booted this game up thought it looked okay, kind of like an old 360 game, but whatever. Must be a good story or something. Speaking of story I guess other than the one eyed girl and the crappy cutscene there isn't really one. Figured since it had the Game of Thrones writer on it it may be cool, but I guess this is the reason why everyone hates the damned show now. He must not be very good, probably another SJW propped up by the hollywood elites. Dodge mechanics are pretty clunky and don't seem to work quite right.. Seems like your character's hit box is larger than Nancy Pelosi's slush fund. Clipping seems to guarantee that the enemies kill you through walls and rocks and other crap, but you never seem to go through them. I presume it's some intentional feature to create a faux sense of challenge to the game. The alternative is that the programmers lack the technical wherewithal to pull of what they're striving for. Now that I think on that though it's probably the latter with the number of bugs this game has. Frame rate drops are pretty harsh and consistently occur on boss encounters. Maybe it would have been a cool game if the story was any interesting or if the developers were worth a lick, but they seem to be reaching for the stars when they can't even grab the dirt off the floor very well. Play God of War any of them and hard if you wanna play a real good game. I'll be taking this back to gamestop and telling them the damned thing is broken to get my money back because it's just awful.",0,2022-03-01,PLAYSTATION 5

kolorahl,"I'm not sure why this game gets such perfect scores from review sites, but since you can read the positives everywhere on the internet even when you're not trying to, let me detail some of the negatives about what is effectively Dark Souls in a brighter environment. You can't pause. Let's say you have an actual life, like your doorbell rings or your child starts screaming or anything else that interrupts you - no pausing, even if you're offline and playing solo. It's 2022 and we're going to give a 10/10 to a game that you can't pause when you're playing solo? Absurd. The graphics aren't great. They're good, but not great. Certainly an upgrade, but nothing exceptional. And the entire UI looks like it's still the original Dark Souls garbage. They even seem to be using a ton of the same sounds. It's like they reused as many assets as possible to avoid having to actually create something new when creating a new game. I appreciate more tutorial-like encounters to help ease you into the world, but the tutorial section is optional and ""hidden"" behind an obtuse message that should have just ended with ""go here for a tutorial"". Basically adding the ability to be more user-friendly without explicitly being more user-friendly. I was expecting way better from the story given the involvement of George RR Martin, but no, it's just as **** and mostly non-existent as any other Dark Souls game. And the writing of the dialog is super cringe most of the time. For context, Witcher 3, which is vastly superior to this game in almost every aspect, received a lower overall score with fewer perfect scores in all. Yet Witcher 3 is more suitable to a multitude of play types and difficulty levels, still has better graphics than this game does despite a 7-year release gap, great dialog and voice acting (overall), an amazing story with wonderful side quests, and you can pause the game if you need to. The only reason I can imagine for this game getting so much critical acclaim is because there's some weird hard-on that the gaming community at large has for Dark Souls. It skews opinions and even rejects common sense at times, in favor of worshipping Dark Souls despite everything that is obviously dated and ill-fitting to a modern gaming experience from a big-name studio that should definitely have the budget and expertise to produce better.",4,2022-03-01,PLAYSTATION 5

traitorkevin,"Elden Ring is, as the critics are saying, a masterpiece. I think FromSoftware still has some improvements they could make to the way their multiplayer works, but it certainly is unique and the audience FromSoftware has spent the past 13 years cultivating seems to generally like it. It's just a bit unwieldy and difficult to grasp at first. But, as with all things, practice makes it much easier. Beyond that criticism, there isn't much I can say against Elden Ring. It's open world is full of interesting and unique encounters. As you progress through the game, it constantly throws curveballs at you, so that you never quite know what to expect. The combat is fun, action-packed, and exciting. It also requires forethought and planning - this isn't a hack'n'slash game. It's an RPG. The graphics look great. I'm seeing people say ""the game runs terrible on PS5."" I have a PS5. I haven't seen anything ""terrible"" about the game I've been playing for the past 40+ hours. I've been playing it with friends who have PS4s. I've heard exactly 0 complaints from them about any aspects of the game's graphics. The art design is also spectacular. FromSoft really knows how to make an enemy that you see and immediately think, ""$#(@! I really don't know if I even WANT to fight that thing..."" Likewise, the music in the game really sets the tone of the world perfectly, and it amps up considerably during memorable encounters. The story is very interesting, but it's told in a sparse and subtle way. If you have played FromSoft games before, you know this. If you haven't, you've probably heard it before. It honestly shouldn't be a surprise if you do literally ANY research into the game before you buy it (which you should always be doing - don't buy a game you know nothing about and don't buy a game based on a single trailer you watched on TV). The narrative is very open and freeform. It doesn't give you a questlog. Instead, you must actually LISTEN to NPCs and deduce what it is they require of you. There are no markers on the map telling you that ""the finish line for the side quest is here."" I encourage anyone who likes RPGs or open-world games to check out Elden Ring. Do some research on FromSoftware games if you've never played one to find out if this is an experience you'll enjoy. This is the most accessible that a FromSoftware game has ever been, but that still doesn't mean everyone will like it. Before you take one of the reviews that gives this game a 0 (which is, frankly, insane) seriously, be sure to check the poster's review history. Chances are high that they either made an account purely to give Elden Ring a 0, or they only give 0s to universally beloved games because...I dunno? I guess it makes them feel original or unique to have such an ""edgy"" viewpoint? I can only assume, after reading most of the 0-4 rating reviews, that these people have not played the game much, if at all, and/or are just bitter that other people are happy about a new Souls-like game when they've never enjoyed FromSoftware games.",9,2022-03-01,PLAYSTATION 5

jordy69,"Please just listen to the game critics and not the user reviews. There are so many negative reviews by angry Horizon Forbidden West fans because they are mad that Elden Ring stole the spotlight, and it stole it rightfully so. Every single criticism of this game is invalid other than the FPS issues, but FromSoftware is going to fix that soon. The world is breathtaking, the graphics are good (despite what the HFW fans are spamming in the reviews), the gameplay is fluid and perfects what other games in the series have not. The story is more immersive and accessible than any other Souls title. The world is the most accessible as well, because if you’re stuck on something you can go literally anywhere else on the gigantic map with so much to explore. All character builds are viable so you can do anything you want and be successful. Accessibility is only an issue when you’re obstinate and try to rush through the game without paying attention. I can’t believe there are so many 1 and 0 reviews this early into the game’s release. I’ve logged about 30 hours so far and I know the people critiquing this game have either never played it and are HFW fanboys or quit because the game posed the slightest challenge because they can’t pay attention to the great amount of help and hints the game gives you. This game is a verifiable 10/10 and absolutely has lived up to the hype. I cannot wait to see what else this game has to offer.",10,2022-03-01,PLAYSTATION 5

L80sKidd,"Definitely not a 0, nor a 10. Much like with Breath of the Wild, you set out and create your own path in a vast open world. No map riddled with markers and points of interest. It’s up to you, the player, to figure out and unfold the game world. Because of this open world design, you can avoid enemy encounters and when you meet a hard boss, you can fall back and prepare for your next confrontation by defeating a variety of enemies (both small and big) in the open world to level up your stats and/or gear. Unlike Breath of the Wild though, Elden Ring doesn’t do much in terms of changing the true and tried combat mechanics of the Souls games; for better or worse, depending on how much you like Souls games. Personally, I’ve tried multiple Souls games like Dark Souls, Bloodborne, Sekiro and most recently Demon’s Souls Remake. Out of that list, only Sekiro stuck with me. I feel like Sekiro nailed the combat mechanics best and the grappling hook made traversal fun. In that regard I wish Elden Ring played more like Sekiro than Dark Souls. I can’t help but compare this open world design to Breath of the Wild and because that game did it so well and came out in 2017, I’d hoped it would take more inspiration. Not being able to climb, or glide down high terrain feels like a step backwards. Such a huge open world should be easy to traverse. Of course you can fast travel to previously discovered ‘Sites of Grace’ and you can summon your trusty steed at any point in the open world; but discovering new places and figuring out how to get to landmarks far in the distance, is more frustrating than fun. On top of that, the game doesn’t have much interactive ways to play around and experiment with in the open world. It is there where the game falls short for me, as the journey should be as fun, or maybe even more fun, than reaching the destination. All of this takes away from the immersion, which makes me wonder if the open world is really just a way for new players (like me) to take away some of the intimidation that comes with the Souls genre. Then there are the performance issues with framerate, on every platform and regardless of how powerful it is. It feels disappointing, because this game deserves (and demands) to be polished. Just like the lack of interaction in the open world, it takes away from the immersion. There have been better games that could’ve been used as an inspiration for this game, by other developers AND by FromSoftware themselves. I understand the disappointment many players feel and I think this game will be very divisive for Souls veterans and new players alike. As I said before, I tried multiple Souls games and only Sekiro stuck with me. I’m not blind for all the missteps and issues Elden Ring has, but I keep wanting to get back to playing the game. The option to retreat and prepare for the next confrontation has eliminated the intimidation I’ve always felt playing Souls games and for the first time I actually enjoy getting my ass handed to me, only to return later to exact my revenge with my newfound skills. It feels extremely rewarding and over 30 hours in I still feel like I’m making progress, without worrying about the end destination. Although I feel like Sekiro had better combat mechanics and that Elden Ring should’ve taken more inspiration from Breath of the Wild in terms of traversal and interaction with the open world, I thoroughly enjoy my time with Elden Ring. Being able to retreat to the open world from difficult enemies, to prepare for the next encounter, takes away a lot of the intimidation and stress I’ve always felt playing Souls games. The technical issues with the framerate are a shame and will hopefully be resolved in a future patch, but they are not enough to refrain myself from enjoying the game.",8,2022-03-01,PLAYSTATION 5

For 20 years I have loved and cherished and immersed myself in gaming: It is my favorite thing to do, it is a huge part of who I am as a person. Elden Ring feels like the culmination of all those 20 years. Elden Ring is the very definition of adventure, curiosity, risk, reward, failure and success. Every square inch of it begs to be investigated, pursued, clawed at and uncovered. It is the essence of what makes video games worth playing. It defines the medium in such a way I've never seen or felt before. I don't say it lightly: Elden Ring is the finest video game ever made.

Class building is surprisingly at one of it best states since Demon souls, with a such a vast choice option that any build can be viable with time and effort. Armor cosmetic could leave much to be desire but make up for it with the mix matching style, but more then make up to it for it weapon system and balance. Despite it low amount of bosses the replay vaule is extrememly high with the vast choice building of builds.

prinex,"FROM Soft games has always been know for their difficult but mostly for their ""japanese"" minimalism. Worlds reduced down to their bare framework - the sense of dreadness, of being hopeless lost in a almost impossible quest. Hope never emerges in Dark Souls, their NPCs destined to die or become hollow. NPCs have few words for you, and the ending which is never a end, just the restart of an eternal loop of despairing and suffering. I played DS for many years. And I was expecting, hoping that this pureness would be preserved in Elden Ring. Instead, I just spoke to some woman who wants me to deliver a letter. Another one was looking for her husband ? Not sure anymore, as I'm not sure what I'm really doing in this game, beside galloping around, collecting flowers and occasionally face some monster. I guess Im supposed to do something but whatever - is more fun and rewarding just to scavenge around as the next shiny item could be just past that rock. And this is the first issue with this game. The second one is what I call ""artificial difficulty"". For some reason some 10 minutes into the game (following the beam guiding you) you hit a boss which is probably good for someone level 40 with well-upgraded weapon. Lets take DS for example, or DS2 / DS3. The first bosses are level-appropriate, doable with a unupgraded weapon, fairly slow and easy to read. Here we deal with a multi-combo jumping spinning area-of-attack as large as ever devil. In DS this would have been a mid-game boss, where you already are familiar with the game and have elemental weapons and so on. But Elden Ring expect me to run around to look for a good weapon, upgrade it, level up some 30 times before I can have a chance. So the game does not do a good job telling you ""yor are underpowered"" - specially as you can stroll by most of enemies to hit the next resting place. So we have now underpowered users sitting in front of a monster boss. And here lies the 3d Elden Ring Problem. While in the past summoning help was the equivalent to ""help me"", this time summoning someone makes things worse. Bosses have more health, do more damage, and the limitation in matchmaking to just be able to summon someone around your level means there are now two underpowered users facing the beast. With the usual deadly consequences. The problem here is mixing the old formula of similar-level to matchmaking with the open world. Soons the users will be spread on such a large level range (also weapon level counts in matchmaking, and there are 25 levels), that coop will become almost impossible. It is still a good game, specially if you play solo. But the magic of the old ""jolly cooperation"" is sadly no more there.",8,2022-03-01,PLAYSTATION 5

RodCurtis,"If you are a fan of FromSoftware games and open-world RPGs Elden Ring is a dream. This game doesn't tell you what you NEED to do. You do what YOU want to do. Go where YOU want to go. | highly recommend starting this game as a Wretch and not watching 100 videos about how to optimise the first levels or get the 'best' gear. Starting in this way makes the experience even more rewarding than it already is. You don't start with weapons that are already better than the first things you find. Everything is valuable, you adapt the way you play based on the things you find. Compare it to games like Valheim or Runescape, you start those adventures with nothing, you get stronger as you explore. If you are struggling on an area or boss you can leave and return when you feel stronger instead of feeling like you are required to do it like previous FromSoftware games. You will know when you aren't strong enough to proceed. The first time you die to a boss, your first thought might be is this is literally impossible... 20 deaths later when you have learnt most of their attacks and he gets to half health you begin to believe. Then get hit by a second phase which makes it seem even more impossible. 40 deaths later getting to the second phase is now a cake walk and you wonder how you ever doubted yourself. Then its just about learning the rest of the mechanics and believing in your skills with a controller or M&K. Finally when the boss falls... an overwhelming sense of accomplishment, and hopefully a huge item upgrade. This is why Elden Ring is so rewarding and everyone who loves a gaming challenge as well as an awesome adventure through a brutal, unforgiving and mysterious world should test their skill and attempt to become.... the Elden Lord.",10,2022-03-01,PLAYSTATION 5

This game is massive. 9.5 for instead of 10 due to the small stuttering and the texture popping on PS5 that are annoying enough to break the immersion, but I am confident that this will be fixed by updates. This game is a masterpiece, can't wait to finish it, and play it again.",10,2022-03-01,PLAYSTATION 5

GenTrailsFan,"Oh, boy another buggy triple-A release. I mean I guess it's to be expected that the same slobs at IGN/Mattyplays/Gamespot/Whatculture/etc that spent 2 or 3 years lying to the general public about Cyberpunk couldn't be trusted on this game either, but I like so many others fell for it. Story is virtually non-existent they were happier than hell to plug George R R Martin's name all over the marketing materials, but I'm not sure what he did. About as much work as he does on his own series I'd surmise, which is NOTHING. You get what amounts to lore dumps on scrolls and flavor text on items passing as a ""story."" There's no major narrative structure. The ""revolutionary"" open world is hollow, lifeless, and boring. I've seen more intriguing open worlds in PS3 games. Speaking of PS3 games that's basically what you're getting here in the visuals department. I guess the AAA industry is so exhausted from bribing publishers and youtubers to give them good scores they don't even bother with the graphics anymore. Art direction is however stunning, seems to be where they spent most of their time. Gameplay is seriously bogged down by numerous bugs and technical issues. Frame rate drops, save crashing, stuttering, janky animations, clipping errors, you name it this game has it. I guess all the 10/10 reviews are based on where the game will be in 2 years once they fix the bugs? That's some optimism for you!

Ekimrellik,"**CONCEPT/9** Open world Dark Souls with increased everything, lore, size, weapons, combat options, bosses, enemy types, the list goes on and on. Personally, I wish the story was told in a more traditional way instead of the usual cryptic style of storytelling from other FromSoft games. **GRAPHICS/8** Beautiful design and art. Unimpressive framerate and it looks just like Dark Souls 3 at times. **SOUND/10** Amazing music and voice acting. The ambience overall is incredible. **GAMEPLAY/9** You have so much freedom to do what you want that you don’t have to take on any bosses if they are too difficult. The beginning of the game still doesn’t tell you much but once you get through the initial hours, the formula and layout of the game will become clear. I felt the game was too big and open at times with not enough interesting things to do and see in each zone but the zones themselves are designed real well. I also wish there were more secrets hidden in obscure spots within the zones. **SUMMARY/10** The game is a brilliant way forward for Dark Souls games. It’s one of the best open world games I’ve ever played.",10,2022-03-01,PLAYSTATION 5
Manu_L,The openworld is so fun to explore - kind of like Breath of the Wild. Everywhere I go I find something new to explore. The story is a typical Dark Souls Story - so dont expect something new here. The only slighty annoying thing are the little bit outdated graphics of the game - but let's be honest FromSoftware games never had the best graphics and their games did not not get famous because of them.,9,2022-03-01,PLAYSTATION 5
Shafi5557,Imagine the entire Dark Souls 1+2+3 but 50 times bigger and 5 times more good looking. The story is complicated. The gameplay is hard but rewarding. The open world-ness is on per with Botw.. The background music does not distract you from combat and bosses move in rhythm to music. I haven't finished the game and I already think this game is the best game of all time. Only reason it's getting negative reviews is that it's too hard for casual gamers and because people don't have a good enough system to play the game due to chip shortages and scalping.. Because of Covid a lot of casual gamers are joining the gaming community but this game is made more for hardcore gamers.,10,2022-03-01,PLAYSTATION 5

The open world isn’t empty this is a open world DS game not Skyrim 2, there isn’t gonna be a lot of side quests compared to other open world games and should already be expected, people expected open world and forgot the DS aspect.

Nowhere do annoying quest markers or arrows take you by the hand and guide you through the world as if on rails. Everything you can find has a purpose or is meaningful. There is no trivial collection stuff. The best part is the sense of openness. You see something in the distance and wonder ""How do I get there?"". Then you try for a while and don't make it. Do something else and then end up at said place 5 hours later. I've really played a lot of open world games. But this open world is a kind of opus magnum. Future open worlds will have to measure up to this. It's big Dark Souls, but in a good way.",10,2022-03-01,PLAYSTATION 5

It takes the mechanics and gameplay of each from game and puts them all together and it works. Combat feels great especially when you start finding new arts of war, combined that with spells and the new mounted combat and jump attacks. It took me a slight adjustment period but I'm hooked. The world is huge and full of loot. The trademark atmosphere that's from soft games are known for is here which is impressive given the open world format.

ContentNeptune3,"This game blew past my every expectation, the enemies and bosses had great movesets that were, of course, punishing but fair. The enemy variety is quite frankly, insane to behold. How they could've put so much variety into that many different creatures is amazing. A few moves here and there were taken from previous FromSoft games, but with the staggering size of everything, it's quite frankly a drop in the bucket. Game devs do this all the time, nothing unusual here. The scenery was absolutely gorgeous: there were breathtaking vistas full of color; castles, churches, mysterious structures dotted the horizon, dungeons and mines below ground beckoned me to explore their depths. The first zone alone blew my mind, the ones that came after just as great. Want intricately designed buildings to explore, classic Dark Souls style? Morne's Castle and Stormveil Castle got you covered. Want to explore an open world on horseback, running through rivers, forests and fields? You can do that too! The graphics, while not as great as something like Demon's Souls Remastered, were still quite good. It's at exactly the level you'd expect for a game that released on both next gen and previous gen hardware. Anyone saying differently is insane, check out screenshots or video yourself. Everything ran smoothly for me as well, I didn't notice any horrendous frame drops or stuttering, it ran as a good as any other game I've played. But really, the feeling of clearing a new zone, and then rounding the corner to experience a completely new area left my jaw on the floor every time. Never did I feel like the game was unfair to me either, and if something seemed too hard, I could easily go level up my stats or weapons elsewhere and come back stronger. Bosses and enemies demand your attention and respect, but failure is solely on the user and not a poorly designed encounter. Quests, like in other FromSoft games, were very much small options to do on the side and offered to flesh out the world in cool ways. If you're coming in expecting to to be led around with map markers to clear bandit camps, I'd recommend playing something else like a new Assassin's Creed instead. That sounds mean, and it isn't meant to be, it's just a fundamentally different type of RPG, and not everyone is gonna know what to expect. And that's ok! Like previous FromSoft games, the wiki will eventually be updated with all pertinent quest information, so if you can't quite find your way through a quest, you can look on there. To me, this game is a 10/10. It isn't perfect, but that isn't what a 10 means in reviews. It completely surpassed my expectations, and every day I woke up feeling like it was Christmas morning with how excited I was to play it. With how many disappointing games released in 2021, we needed this win. I hope whoever reads this doesn't take the 0's as true fact. Most are disingenuous and review bomb worthy, citing issues on the PC port (this isn't even the PC game) or just straight up lying. The mixed reviews are a far better barometer of dislike, and if you're on the fence about buying, try reading those. People giving the game a 0 because of ""PS3 graphics"" aren't going to be giving accurate assessments of the title. Overall, Elden Ring hits every mark, and it was much better than I could've ever hoped for. It's different than a lot of the more popular RPG's that people are more familiar with. Please don't write it off because it doesn't guide you along as close as other games too. It's an experience that I've not felt before, and it has raised the bar for games in general. I hope you can experience it for yourself.",10,2022-02-28,PLAYSTATION 5

Yngve,"Massively overrated game. Elden rings feels like its built from 80s simple game design with 90s 3d game controls. It’s more a hack and slash game and not much of an RPG. Soldiers and monsters fight along side against one common enemy – you. The AI is less than what found in the first Zelda game made in the 80s. Monsters and soldiers run in mindless circles and feel misplaced on the map. You can kill a soldier in clear sight in front of another soldier and they won’t mind. Controls are simple and close to what you expect from the first 3d console games of the 90s. This game is also difficult for the wrong reasons. When you fight monsters, you get runes (money) that may be used to buy stuff from static NPCs scattered around the world. You also use money to buy level ups. If you die after a big boss fight and earn a lot of XP (or money), you loose all the money. This logic makes no sense and makes leveling up difficult unless you stick to grinding easy monsters. Leveling up is also very tedious as leveling gets you one stat, and one stats makes up for 1-2% more damage or HP. So if you want to balance out the difficulty, you are likely to play hundreds of hours of grinding, and also likely to hit the max stat before it even makes the game easier. Graphics won’t blow you away but feels OK. Nothing though feels polished. The world feels empty and sterile compared to Witcher. There are no towns and cities with people, and NPCs are placed around with lack of backstory. All in all this feels like a sandbox template with very little effort put into it. I also don’t know what role George R R Martin took in the storytelling as there is hardly any story to it. If you don’t like Dark Souls, this is not the game for you. In fact, it’s one of the worst games I’ve ever played. Why this game gets 10/10 from most critics is beyond me and can only be concluded in one of two cases. Paid review, or the critic is a massive Dark Soul fan. The only good thing I could think is that the Launch edition came with a few stickers and patches, and it’s nice to see they put some effort into that. The sad part is that this game tells other developers that you can get away with a good score just by releasing a standard sandbox template with nothing in it.",1,2022-02-28,PLAYSTATION 5

Vnin2007,I have payed many of the soulsbourne games before and I never enjoyed them very much but Elden Ring is one of the greatest games I have ever played in my entire life. With so many video games in recent years being open world's and them all being so similar it is so nice to see a new and fresh take on open world. There is no quest log or objective markers the game is just about exploring all there is in the way of guidance is a beam of light pointing the way you are supposed to go to continue the story at some checkpoints. But all side quests and areas you have to discover on your own and that is so cool because most open world's tell you exactly where to go and so you just head straight for that direction no really exploring alot but this game since you don't know exactly where to go you have to explore to find everything and it tells completely different then most open world's. The world is massive and has so many secrets to find and areas to explore. There are entire massive underground areas that you find just through exploring and can be completely missed. Everywhere you go you never know what you are gonna find even after 60 hours you are still finding completely new and unexpected things. If you for some reason just want a traditional souls game and want to miss out on the amazing world the game has you can do that too because you can just follow the path through the story though I highly recommend not doing that because the world is one of the main things that makes this game so great. The game is hard obviously but the feeling you get after trying a boss for hours and finally beating it in amazing. I still highly recommend this game for people who don't want to spend hours and bosses because if you want to you can summon other players to help you defeat the bosses and it makes the game alot easier (the closest you get to an easy mode). This game it is so unique and special and there is not really any games that it is even comparable to. Whether you like past souls games or not and whether you like open world games or not you should atleast try this game because it is nothing like past souls games or open world games or really any games for that matter.,10,2022-02-28,PLAYSTATION 5

Bilathenio,"40 hours in and I’m still constantly discovering new things, the atmosphere in some areas is unparalleled, the bosses are hard and can be frustrating but they never feel unfair. If you’re not into lots of trial and error or looking for an easy pick up and play game this probably isn’t the one for you. I wouldn’t call myself a particularly good souls gamer but with enough willpower or cheesing if you have to you can make it through. For people saying character design is bad or there’s an empty open world it’s not true, many people couldn’t make it past the first or second boss and it left a bad taste in their mouth seeing other people progress and have fun, these games aren’t for everyone and that’s ok but reviewbombing is just dumb. The graphics aren’t the most amazing but personally that doesn’t really matter to me. I played on PS5 and haven’t seen any noticeable graphical issues but I’ve heard PC port is a little rough but being patched. Overall lots of fun and when you get tired of being smacked by a boss there’s a huge world with many secrets to discover.",9,2022-02-28,PLAYSTATION 5
bigdc666,"Nostalgia. It's big business now. Seems like everyone is cashing in on 80's and 90's kids childhoods. But why? Why are people willing to pay money for something old and possibly obsolete? The simple answer is bliss. That exhilaration of feeling something new, The unlimited Thrill of receiving a reword for achieving what felt like an imposable goal that only a child can know. The first time you were excited and scared at the same time, The friendships...friendships before drama, when the only thing required to be friends was that you were all young and ignorant of an adult world. As we know being an adult isn't nearly as exciting and is rarely fun. So of course people (like me) in there 30's 40's and 50's will pay cash for a chance at feeling that bliss, if only for a single second, if only one more time. Video games were my very first love. Karate Kid on the NES is the first game I remember playing. And it called to me. The colors racing by, the thrill of surviving one more screen as I scrolled right kicking and punching. Then at the local arcade it was WWF Wrestlefest and Afterburner that gave me that same thrill, That sense of pure bliss. Other games made me feel that way over the years. But it came fewer and farther between as I got older. And it wasn't just games feel this way. It was going to a new friends house for the first time, playing in a construction area at night, riding my first wheelie on my bike, my first ollie, exploring abandoned houses with my friends. when we were kids it was pure bliss all the time. As life carries on, there are still wonders. the first time being intimate with someone, falling in love, your first promotion at work. But for most of us our day to day life's have become the status quo, go to work, be a good parent, and a good spouse. But no matter how good your life turns out, for a lot of us there will always be a longing for that bliss. That feeling of discovery we had so many years ago. Eldon Ring absolutely makes me feel that way again. I cant exactly say why. I never liked any of the other games made by FROM software. In fact I disliked them. But this game has kept me on the edge of my seat for the 30 hours I've put into it. I'm glued to my TV in a way that I haven't been for years. My heart races, and my adrenaline has been off the charts! Not just the game either, I've had my laptop In front of me the whole time, on forums, wiki's, and watching YouTube videos. Its the most ""fun"" I've had as long as I can remember. Around every corner is something new and exciting, every cave, Ruin, or castle is just absolutely filled with discovery. The constant fear of losing your progressions is ever looming giving this game that fear and excitement feeling from my youth. There is nothing like discovering an area with no messages anywhere and knowing you might be the first player to ever find this place. It's constant exhilaration. I could get into the mechanics, the graphics, what features the game has or lacks. But I wont. I could talk about the length of the game. But I also wont, Because for me it doesn't matter. Im 30 hours in and if the game ended now, or lasted another 100 hours I would consider it the greatest game ever made. What I do care about is how this game makes me feel. And it makes me feel like a kid again. Not for a second, but for hours. I never thought I would feel these kinds of emotions again. And for that I am so thankful. I usually dont write reviews, But I had to let someone somewhere know how amazing this game is. In my opinion this game is without a doubt the G.O.A.T..",10,2022-02-28,PLAYSTATION 5

Breikzer,"En gustos se rompen géneros y definitivamente este juego no es para todos. Me parece un juego terrible en el mal sentido, entiendo que al ser un juego Souls sea difícil pero con Elden Ring a los desarrolladores se les ha ido la mano y no se siente difícil sino más bien injusto. Me explico: En Elden Ring la dificultad se basa en lo lento, débil y torpe que es tu personaje, mientras que los enemigos son rápidos, fuertes y ¡DIOS MIO! Vaya que aguantan los golpes. Conforme avances podrás ir mejorando poco a poco tus habilidades, para esto necesitaras runas, así que prepárate para farmearlas como loco porque son indispensables, aquí es donde entra la parte ABURRIDA del juego. Algunos jefes son tan fuertes que si no subes tu nivel te será imposible vencerlos y ahí es donde me choca mucho Elden Ring. Tan solo para matar al primer jefe principal, **** 2 horas y tuve que subir al nivel 23 para lo cual me **** 7 horas de juego, de esas 7 horas la mitad puedo decir que fueron aburridas, ya que, aunque el mundo de Elden Ring es enorme, tienes que tener mucho cuidado de no morir y perder todas tus runas, entonces no te puedes divertir como quisieras debido a este factor. Al final Elden Ring se basa en: morir, mejora tus habilidades, vuelve a morir, sigue mejorando, muere, muere, muere, muere, muere, muere, muere, muere... Y no porque seas en si un mal jugador, sino porque simplemente el juego es injusto y te CASTIGA por cualquier pequeño error de forma despiadada. Si tu idea de un juego divertido es la de morir, morir, morir y morir, **** de mínimo 2 horas en derrotar a un jefe y pasar largas sesiones de juego farmeando para crecer de nivel, Elden Ring es para ti. Si prefieres un juego retador y que no se sienta TAN injusto te recomiendo mejor acercarte a juegos como Sekiro o Bloodborne. Elden Ring simplemente no vale la pena.",3,2022-02-28,PLAYSTATION 5
TheDevilCorrect,"None of the bugs that people are writing about are deal breaking, and fairly customary in these series of games. It's just a another source of frustration and losing runes/souls. You'll become pretty accustom to this (eventually) depending on how many years you've been playing these type of games. You either accept it, or break your monitor...there's no in between. I can't help think that the angry user reviews can be a reflection of this. Some kid flips out, loses 25k in runes and starts writing horrible reviews. I know that's not all the cases, but I'll bet it's a lot of cases.

Mackanii,"First off! enough with emotional review bombs from users who forgot that this type of games are for a selective player base and dose not appeal to the general **** IS A HARD GAME, get over it. in its core it is really a true souls like game with narrow levels with more paths to take to get forward. It also give u these huge areas for u to explore outside of that if u fell like the bosses get u a bit too hard. this is to get it to be easier for newer players. the style of the graphics is so cool. i love how the art style makes up for the graphics overall. its not the most heavily graphical game u have ever played but the style and art in this game makes it as one of the most beautiful titles i have played for a long time. Good graphics don't need to be high polygon levels.. as many seem to think. the combat feels amazing. never have i played every new weapon i got or tried its style as much as i did in this title. the bosses are a huge step up from former titles and it feels like the ai can really think of what u are going to do next. sure this game has some few annoying things but if u can look past them and see the entire game as it is. I believe its the first 10/10 game in a long time. the lore is more present in this game and the world comes more alive than ever before. they really smashed it out of the park with this one. its on my top 5 games of all time. right next to Witcher 3 and that's saying something, what I have gathered is that ppl complain about it being to hard and not holding ur hand. but honestly I have been more engaged in a game for a long time. for from software to actually give that benefit of the doubt that the player can figure out where to go based on this games awesome level design and story bits make u really think how braindead and handhold other titles are now. let that sink in. I'm looking forward to see what from software brings to the table in the future as they just raised the bar so high, (80hours played)",10,2022-02-28,PLAYSTATION 5

Lemures1000,"Geez this is a very overhyped game. This is really just souls 3 open world. The main positives are that many of the bigger enemies look really cool and have cool looking animations. But there are A LOT of negatives. Graphics look rough at times and do not have many of the polished features that other high profile games have such as good face animation or enviornment responding to what you do, very clunky fighting mechanics and I can't stress that enough, unnecessarily unforgiving boss fights, and many and I mean many reused bosses and enemies from past Souls games littered throughout. In my opinion it seems the over the top and unbalanced difficulty is put in place to mask the clunky fighting mechanics and big flaws in the game. Dark souls cultists will love this game and claim everyone who doesn't needs to GG and that they just don't like difficult games, but gamers who are used to other games whether they are very difficult or on the easier side, technical fighting games, and polished open world games will see this game as not designed for them hence the misleading marketing push for this game to try and sell it. It would be one thing if I had fun playing this but I didn't. I feel like I wasted my money on an expensive game. I don't recommend getting this. The fighting mechanics are the biggest disappointment for me because it's not really different. When comparing the fighting mechanics to say Nioh 2, it was just boring. Nioh 2 had waay more moves and a waay deeper fight system to perfect in a souls style kind of game. Why didn't From Software learn from that? The fighting mechanics alone should make this game not worthy of perfect reviews in light of Nioh 2 even from the cultists. And the reviews and marketing push on this game have really been misleading. I suspect because they know most people will not enjoy playing this game's highly clunky fighting mechanics, unnecessary and unbalanced difficulty, and being left to deal with no tutorial except the From Software cultists. Do you want a game that you have to look up how to find or get past anything every step of the way on YouTube? Most people would say I don't might doing that here and there but if the game is reliant on that because of how it was designed or poorly designed then no. And anyone claiming this is like Breath of the Wild is an idiot. Horizon Forbidden West is an easier game but it is a better designed game overall and should be easily beating this game rating wise. Reviewers reeeally failed consumers that were not FS cultists on this and should be shamed for it.",4,2022-02-28,PLAYSTATION 5

Almost everywhere I go there is some crazy new boss, event, or strange scenario going on. The game does a good job at rewarding you for exploring places and has good general progression. The combat. Lets be real, the combat is the bread and butter of souls games. Elden ring is no exception, they have fine tuned their formula with a few new interesting twists which makes for even more varied builds and great fights between all sorts of bosses.

O jogo pegou as melhores partes da série souls e misturou com as capacidades atuais dos consoles e dos PC mas é claro que tem uns erros ali e aqui de mal otimização e o fato de ser OP o mago, mas isso é relevante comparado ao quão ruins estão os jogos dos últimos tempos como cyberpunk e etc. Mas no final vale a pena pegar o valor abusivo que a inflação está nos danos, porque esse jogo é uma obra de arte com esse estilo e gráficos Melhor souls like que temos até hoje",10,2022-02-28,PLAYSTATION 5

Rektnarok91,"It's all opinion but I'm surprised by the masterpiece status. This game is addictive af, I can play for an aggregious amount of time but I'd still put it below DS1, DS3, BB, and Sekiro. I may be unable to put it down but that doesn't make it the best, the gameplay loop just never feels concluded. For all the amazing aspects of the game and being the most refined Dark Souls (specifically) combat, there's just more busy work and lack of intentional pacing than the rest of Fromsoft's greats. It never reaches the highs the other games do and though it's open world, it feels much less of a unique and revolutionary game changer like BB or Sekiro were to the Fromsoft format (I consider those 2 games masterpieces and my favorite Fromsoft combat systems). The open world is cool but it does make everything feel less specifically intended and crafted, & you're often either over leveled or underleverd for an area. And while the areas can be beautiful they don't stand out in memory to me like DS1 interconnected world, BB amazing Lovecraft aesthetic, or Sekiro beauty and fun traversal. And while the world style feels reminiscent of Breath of the Wild as you figure it out naturally without markers or arbitrary blocks, it pales in comparison with little variety in gameplay when you explore, just different enemies and visual environments. I'd honestly have preferred a DS4 or BB 2 or Sekiro 2 over this tbh. Open world is cool but I haven't really found any reason why this is an improvement to a the semi linear design of the other games; I've mostly found it amusing at some points, and frustrating at others. It also has more bugs than either BB (which ran low fps at times but the graphics stayed consistent) or Sekiro did on the PS4. Quality mode is literally unplayable, with likely sub 30 fps, and performance mode has noticable pop in. It's weird how I think it's more visually sparse than those 2 games but has more trouble running on brand new hardware. Still, game of the year for me no doubt. Even a bad Fromsoft game (like DS2, which I do enjoy) is still miles ahead of most AAA studios. So this being great, but not a masterpiece imo, makes it a joy to play. It's the first AAA in awhile that I felt worthy of the price and genuinely want to finish while living up to expectations (I didn't expect it to be a 10/10, more like 8.5/10).",8,2022-02-28,PLAYSTATION 5

Skyborg,"This game is truly a masterclass achievement. It is everything you could hope for from an open world action RPG. Elden Ring has an incredible amount passion and intention behind even the smallest little details and mechanics sprinkled across the world. This kind of polish is not often seen in AAA games anymore unfortunately. Looking at this game from an artistic standpoint, the scenery, architecture and atmosphere of this world is unmatched by almost any other game I've played. The open world feels lively and has a rich presence that invites exploration which you are actually rewarded for unlike many other 'open world' games. The story is intriguing and fairly accessible to follow unlike the prior souls games. From software really has outdone themselves with this game and it deserves all the praise it is receiving. There are some small performance issues including stuttering and FPS drops that some players are experiencing after release. I have not experienced any of these issues that hinder my enjoyment or experience so I left this out my score.",10,2022-02-28,PLAYSTATION 5

I love that it isn't hand-holdy and respects the player enough to let them just play the game instead of chasing objectives and map markers, this was a huge concern of mine when I found out the souls formula was being adapted to open world.

You litteraly traverse over empty lands with a group of enemies here and there and ocassional cave where you fight mini boss(could compare it to nier:automata, but elden ring feels even more empty). Combat is the same as in every dark souls game. Hell, even interface is the same thing. Both graphics modes you can choose are trash. But hey, you can jump and ride a horse!

Admotive9300,Outdated graphics and stutter on ps5! Boring open world and outdated gameplay mechanics! Ik can't Imagine how this game had a higher score then Horizon . Sry to say but 60 bucks in the garbage,4,2022-02-28,PLAYSTATION 5
Nicko970,"I own the game on ps5, and I’m roughly 17 hours in, I can personally say that my experience has been amazing, every few minutes the game hitches and the frame rate drops to maybe 45 fps at the most worse of cases (running on performance mode). But I’ve only experienced that maybe a handful of times when the screen if chock full of enemies and a lot of special effects… is unfortunate, but FromSoft are onto it. I believe any PS5 player who says it’s unplayable is bs. I’ve watched streamers on pc have full frame lockups during boss battles. Actual review time. I’ve played demon souls a handful of times, currently struggling with blood borne, and finally getting good at sekiro, never actually finished a dark souls though, use to get way to mad and never pick up the titles again. I won’t lie, Elden Ring? She hits hard as well, punishing at worst. But maybe I’ve just grown up a little but I find so much joy in the challenge, and once I overcome that one guy who’s been wiping the floor with me, I feel I stoppable until I meet his cousin 30 seconds later I’ll walk up on a boss and have my ass beat. But that okay, I’ll level up and come back later, that is how this game is meant to be played, Margit, the first boss will beat your ass unless you chose a ranged/sorcery class and build upon it. Go explore the world, it truly is amazing, but not perfect. Nearly everything you can see I’ve virtually every vista is touchable, apart from water, tarnished sink like halo Spartans. There are fun enemy’s and characters peppered everywhere, some don’t come out until a specific time of day, The graphics, this ain’t no horizon forbidden west, but you shouldn’t have expected that, graphics is not what souls/borne is about, the mechanics and gameplay with a flood of wacky characters and lore….. and death. I’m running performance mode, on ps5 on a 4K hdr tv. And i can say with confidence it IS an upgrade from all previous in visuals, especially in the effects and animations. All others compare it to The Demon Souls remake, but that’s not a fair comparison, that was made by a seperate dev team, under supervision of Sony, making A CONSOLE LAUNCH TITLE! Of course it will be stunning, and take full advantage of the hardware and software, it was a software flex for Sony. As well as a faithful REMAKE of a cult classic by another team. Overall, Elden Ring has been a blast, and I’m only like 18% completed. If you enjoy the souls genre, get it, and play it, if you need to wait for patches, then do so. It will still be worth it. 9/10, due to the performance hiccups, and only time will let if the entry becomes a 10/10, a true cult classic.",9,2022-02-28,PLAYSTATION 5

The game is absolutely gigantic, so many NPC's, secret areas, etc. After getting over the first ""hump"" which takes a few hours, you will be immersed into a Souls experience like never before. My only gripe with this game is the performance / graphics. There are lots of texture pops, frame rate drops, and graphically the game is not up to par with the franchise's last game Demon Souls remake, but hopefully this is fixed with future patches.

TayterJ,"Only current downside to this game that I can possibly come up with is the state of its performance on release. I play it on PC, but I have heard it is having significant issues on the PS5. This is obviously something that will be fixed with time. On the game itself: The graphics are absolutely stupendous, if you think they are bad, I don't know what to tell you. Go play an EA game where the whole budget went to graphics and none on gamplay. This game is beautiful. The textures are high-res, the weather affects the bushes, trees, and grass. The effects like a big impact, an explosion, or a magic spell are very well done. The gameplay: It is the Souls games combat refined and perfected. The diversity of possible stat combinations, weapons, and playstyles is through the roof. Where in previous games you had the option of pure STR, pure DEX, DEX/INT, STR/FTH, or INT/FTH, now the game much more freely lets you mix and make your own unique build. You just have to go and find the pieces. If you've played Dark Souls 1, you might know that it was lauded for it's openness. If you had played it before, you could make a beeline straight to a certain item, area, or weapon and tackle parts of the game in any order you want (to a degree) well, ER has brought that back in full force. Speedruns for this game may take decades to evolve. You can go ANYWHERE, even if a boss blocks your path, if you have the skill to brute-force it, you can go claim whatever weapon or item you need to make your special run possible. And the map is colossal. It definitely didn't take the shape I was expecting, but even hearing how big it was, I was still astonished. I've seen some criticisms that the world is too big, and empty. This couldn't be further from the truth. The world is full and alive. There is loot or an enemy, or an NPC waiting to sell you a rare item around every corner. Unassuming cliffside? There's a little tunnel that goes into a sprawling mine. A random shack on the shore? There's a merchant in there, and he has just the weapon you were looking for. Heading to the lonely corner of the map where there's sure to be nothing? Nope. Huge optional dungeon full of loot, challenges, and puzzles. Also, despite the size of the world, even if you've seen a certain area so many times you're sick of it, you have a FAST horse, and you can fast-travel any time you aren't in combat. Not only is the world big, but the SCALE of the things within it are outrageous. Elden ring presents itself as having an Epic atmosphere and it delivers on it. It takes itself seriously. There are some incredibly majestic enemies, almost like Shadow of the Colossus. Don't listen to the contrarians. This game is actually BETTER than the hype. If you are looking for a game that is both challenging and freeing at the same time, it's for you. Some of the bosses aren't for the faint-hearted. Embrace death. It's part of the gameplay loop. But maybe wait and listen for word on performance optimizations, just in case. The game is certainly playable at high settings, and I have just under the recommended PC specs. It's just that some enemies, animations, locations, etc. Cause some stuttering. Hopefully it is fixed soon. If it does get completely fixed, this is one of the greatest games EVER made.",10,2022-02-28,PLAYSTATION 5

JTG97,"In a world of where most large game studios choose to sacrifice quality material and respect to their community over next gen-updates and high performance, FromSoftware stand out. This isn’t a game about delivering a next generation cutting edge graphical evolution from its predecessors, but rather a game about continuing to evolve from the formula that made From successful and implementing new and big ideas to their core mechanics. It’s true the game doesn’t hold hands and isn’t trying to be accessible to everyone, but their past work has never been about that. It’s also true that the game has issues with frame drops on some platforms and doesn’t always look perfect, but for what it achieves and what it’s trying to do in a world this large more than makes up for some issues which are sure to be fixed. FromSoftware could have chosen to make another large open world with weak and uninteresting dialogue, repetitive and boring exploration with the same mechanics we’ve seen in every single other game for the last decade or two, or focused on incredible graphics and unfulfilling gameplay that is safe but accessible, however, they chose to stay true to their core community and expand on what has been working for them. The original Zelda games don’t hold up in todays world because of their graphics, it’s because of the love and care put into creating the world. It’s about the feeling you get when you achieve something after completion. It’s about dedicating time and experiencing the world you are playing in. It’s sad to see so many complaints about how games look these days when those are things that have never really mattered at the end of the day, it’s about the immersion and feeling the games bring.",10,2022-02-28,PLAYSTATION 5

Hyph,"Quite possibly the best video game ever created. It majestic....a hybrid sandbox of high fantasy and horror. I originally played DS3 after my roommate forced me to play. He would knock on my door every day and ask me to play but I had heard ""souls games hard."" Eventually I played and one late night alone in the irithyll dungeon the game clicked and made sense. Ever since then I have played every one...DS1/2/BB/Sekiro. Elden Ring is a stunning combination of all of those games put into one. It takes heavy influence from games like Shadow of the Colossus & Breath of The Wild. The atmosphere & mood is the defining factor here. You will feel lost, overwhelmed, frustrated and triumphant all at once. The game is asking you to get lost and through that feeling you find yourself. Even with all of my prior experience the game still scares me. I move cautiously & take calculated risks. Although sometimes I end up in areas where I cant turn back and I have to reach inside of myself for something more....I have to overcome myself & become more in that moment. Its hard to explain this feeling or to quantify it but it is the exact experience that Souls fans love and why the games are so adored. No other piece of media or games ask this of you. They hold your hand...Souls games leave you stranded on the side of the road and say ""good luck"" I read some reviews prior to this and they are complaining about graphics....about design...about frame **** of them are meaningless if you manage to let the game take you and unfold itself before you.",10,2022-02-28,PLAYSTATION 5

It's a game that respects it's audience and treats them like adults, it challenges them at every turn and gives them a world to actually discover and lose themselves in. It's absolutely mind-blowing that this game exists - I never thought I'd see a video game like this in my life. Yes, the game is challenging - but that's precisely the point. I don't want to play a game that a seven year old child can pick up and play, because in the end that's who that game is tailored towards. I want to be respected. I want to be tested. I want the thrill of discovery and triumph. This game has that in spades. The graphics aren't superb, but honestly, I like it like that. The way they are it helps to create the sense of unreality, like a living dream that can be stepped into at any time. The graphics aren't what's important - it's the design. It's a meticulous and well-wrought world and some, unfortunately, are unable to look up from the ground to see that. If you have some patience and give this game the time it deserves you will be well rewarded with one of the greatest gaming experiences of your life.

cheesehead3919,"Anyone giving this game a 10/10 is incapable of being objective about a game made by FromSoftware. For anyone who want Dark Souls in an open world, this game is for you. However this will not appeal to a large number of people. This is touted as being ""the most accessible Souls game ever"" which may in fact be the case. If it is, it still has a long way to go. The lack of markers on the map is supposed to ""give you more incentive to explore the world"" when in fact it just makes everything tedious. The lack of a quest log means that you have to manually keep track of any side quests, which is absolutely absurd that a game in 2022 doesn't have a quest log. I honestly can't even think of how that can be construed as a positive. In terms of graphics, it looks like a late PS3/early PS4 game and it has FPS issues even on PS5. The UI looks like something out of the early 2000s. As for the story, most of the side quests actually have a better story than the main story, which is kinda sad. You're likely either going to need a second playthrough or some googling to fully grasp the story, which is pretty bad game design. Don't take lessons from Kingdom Hearts when it comes to story. To summarize, if you like Dark Souls, you'll probably like this game. If you don't want to feel like the game you're playing is a chore, steer clear from this game.",2,2022-02-28,PLAYSTATION 5
vashkor,"Elden Ring has a lot of mechanics carried over from the previous Soulsborne games, layered with a ton of new and welcomed mechanics, combined with an enormous yet dense handcrafted open world. There is a lot to love, and a lot that will be a hit or miss for many people, even for the Soulsborne fans. I personally am loving the whole package, especially how the game encourages curious explorations, and rewards them with surprising unique encounters and rewards. Miyazaki, in his typical way, engages in an ambiguous non-verbal dialogue with the players. As usual, a lot is communicated through environmental storytelling, scattered scripts, and gameplay. However, this time around I am finding it easier to read into. Big changes in approach will be needed for the people coming in with a muscle memory.

BradPig,"Elden ring is a good game but it turns out that it is more of the same, the same difficulty, the same gameplay, simply its novelty is that it is an open world, it is more of the same when it comes to an old graphics engine. How could have almost perfect grades? I just don't get it, it's full of bugs, pop up, fog, etc. Those who rated it forgave all this just like that. That does not mean that repeating the formula gives you many hours of exploration and why not? of frustration. In general it is a very inflated game by the media, it is not even remotely what they wanted to make it seem. It is not perfect, it is not open to all, where is the objectivity? It's a shame that they behave like this.",3,2022-02-28,PLAYSTATION 5
lx2112,"A game designed to waste your time, now with a big open world to waste even more of it. The series it’s not officially from is based on the idea of a challenge via memorizing attack patterns. Guess what you do in between those many deaths required to memorize it? Run back to where you were. Over and over again. Even farther now that there’s a big open world to go through again... and again... and again... This game is a test of patience, and anyone who has literally anything better to do should avoid it. Value your time. Life isn’t so long as to waste your seconds on this pile of turd.",1,2022-02-28,PLAYSTATION 5
Jhoge04,"This is going to sound strange coming from me, a massive From Software fan who's been greatly looking forward to Elden Ring, but I actually have mixed feelings about this game. I've put about 15 hours into the game so far, and I'm still mostly exploring the starting area, Limgrave, so perhaps there's much better content to see as you progress a bit further, or perhaps I'm just missing something. But, thus far, I have two main issues with the experience. The first issue is that I feel like I lack any kind of specific, concrete, long-term goal. What exactly am I supposed to be working towards? All I've been told in-game is to somehow ""become an Elden Lord."" It's such a vague task however that I'm unable to wrap my head around how to specifically go about achieving it. What does becoming an Elden Lord entail? Who knows. I can assume it entails exploring further and further into the Lands Between and ultimately fighting a final boss, after which you may be presented with the opportunity to ""become an Elden Lord."" But this is ultimately a guess, and because the game doesn't give you this goal in concrete terms, it has made a lot of what I've done in the game so far feel very aimless and strangely pointless. It doesn't feel like I'm working towards anything specific, and therefore I feel almost disincentivized to engage with what seems to be the only activity the open world has yet to offer - fighting enemies. Which brings me to my second issue - the content in the open world. I've explored Limgrave now for about 15 hours, as I've said. I haven't discovered a single interesting thing that wasn't in some way a fight. Where exactly is this wealth of content that every review claims is around every corner? I've discovered random boss encounters; these are pretty cool. I've discovered lots of small, medium, and large groups of enemies; these are generally less cool. Fighting enemies in Souls games has always been more about the macro reward - progression along a set, geographically linear (relatively) path that inches you closer and closer to some concrete objective - rather than fighting just for its own sake. But that's all it feels like I'm doing here. There are chests with various items in some enemy camps, but these have been pretty few so far, and the items contained within are typically just ""meh."" It feels like a lot of simply fighting for the sake of fighting, and that just doesn't constitute worthwhile and compelling content for an open world in my opinion, if that's all there is to do. I hate to do it, but I'm going to compare this experience with that of Breath of the Wild, because tbh I can't play an open world game without at least subconsciously making this comparison every step of the way. In Breath of the Wild, you're given a very simple and concrete objective right off the bat. ""Defeat Ganon."" It's so easy to understand. You're going to fight Ganon. It's going to be a physical battle. You know you're going to need to get stronger, you're going to need more health, more stamina, better gear, etc. Therefore, you can proceed with purpose, and every choice you make in the game can be contextualized, even when it doesn't necessarily have anything to do with defeating Ganon. Some things you'll do will feel directly tied to that goal, and other things won't feel related at all, but having that concrete goal gives purpose and context to your actions, and as a player you feel this, even if it's only subconsciously. Secondly, there's just so much to do in Hyrule! Fighting enemies is just one activity among many, as opposed to the only real content around the open world. On my first play-through of BotW I actually ignored and avoided enemy groups frequently, because I was having so much fun just doing everything else. I felt like there was such a variety of content, and importantly, it was all so much fun to do, and a lot of it just for its own sake. Finding Koroks was an enjoyable activity that put a smile on my face, regardless of the reward you get for doing it. Fighting random pockets of enemies in Elden Ring is not really all that fun, and especially so when it doesn't have the needed context of a concrete goal or objective. So, although I am enjoying Elden Ring to an extent, right now I fail to see how the open world is an asset to the Souls formula. I'm more inclined to say that it's a detriment, as it doesn't offer any real novelty in the way of content, and possibly distracts from the aspects of a Souls game that I find compelling. Like I said, I've explored Limgrave for about 15 hours now, and a lot of that time spent has felt aimless and unrewarding. I don't feel like I'm really progressing, because I don't have a concrete goal to work towards, and the content isn't necessarily all that fun or engaging for its own sake. I hope my experience gets better and better as I play, that it eventually just ""clicks"" and really hooks me, but as of right now my feelings are mixed.",7,2022-02-28,PLAYSTATION 5

YokaiBEATS,"Yeah, the performance ****. The graphics are also far from what a game released in 2022 should look like and that’s why I’m rating it with 9 instead of 10. But holy ****, is this game good! The open world, the lore you have to discover by yourself and so much more make Elden Ring the ultimate Souls game. To everyone saying that there is no story and too little explanation on what to do: You are most likely new to this series and that’s why you need to take yourself some time to understand the games mechanics and lore properly. The game may be considered as an open world rpg, but since it is so different from other games of that category, it fits itself into a whole new subgenre that might feel weird to people who are not familiar to the Souls series. That’s why it’s important to get familiar with it to truly enjoy the experience Elden Ring has to offer.",9,2022-02-28,PLAYSTATION 5

Modern_Reviews,"Tagline : ""Most overrated Runescape clone, hyped up by people who hate the fact that GTA and Assassin's Creed are popular"" What specs you need to run it 60fps - 1080p or 4K, without stutter or lag? - Honest answer is that, no matter how good your PC is, no matter, if you have PS5, this game will perform horribly and only thing you can do is wait for multiple patches. This game goes into same category of games, that have been extremely overhyped and extremely underdelivered. Other examples would be ""Cyberpunk 2077"", ""Fallout 76"", ""Anthem"", ""Battlefield 2042"" and ""Elden Ring"" is another fine addition to that list. So what new groundbreaking mechanics, graphics, open world design, innovative combat or interesting story this game offers? - Pretty much none of these. Graphically (for some weird reason) this game goes back to 2012/2013. But 2012/2013 had lots of great games and at times ""Elden Ring"" even looks beautiful, especially the sky, but ground and grass textures are pretty much worse than some 2013 games. For 2022 AAA release this is bad. Game that gets Metascores 95/97 in 2022, should have way more work put into it. Next up is open world design - There's extreme amount of boring looking, absolutely empty areas. This is automatically bad open world design, because these empty areas, that doesn't even look good have zero purpose to be there. Other areas that actually have something, okay let's make that clear, all that other areas have is trees and monsters. Endless amount of monsters that are simply sitting there, doing nothing, waiting for you to slay them. This is literally Runescape game design 101, i have been playing Runescape since 2004, i know what i'm talking about. Quests (if you can even call them) are extremely short, boring and you can literally ignore all of them. It's usually some lady asking you to go somewhere, get something, get it back to her. Most hilarious thing is that game doesn't show that you have completed any of them, which basically means that by the end of the game, you forget that you even did these. Runescape has more complex lore, quests and writing than this game can only dream of. Why i'm talking about Runescape and not Skyrim, you might ask - Well because lore wise, Skyrim would be too tough challenger for this game. Combat is extremely similar to Dark Souls 3, game that released 6 years ago. Same animations, same everything. Anyone who says in that case that ""Innovation is overrated"" has no right to criticize Rockstar or Ubisoft ever again, just saying. Anyone who says that having horse is innovative must be a troll, because having this empty open world without any transportation, would be almost insulting. All in all very weak release, only fun i had in this whole game were two boss fights - Margit and Godrick, i have to say they have extremely unfair combos, attacks and they are pointlessly difficult to beat, especially for 2 first bosses, but at least they have some interesting lore and cool monster design. 1 point for beautiful sky design, 1 point for Margit boss design and 1 point for Godrick boss design. Overall score 3/10 - Not recommending, unless you have never played open world game before, but even then, you just could play older open world games that are way better.",3,2022-02-28,PLAYSTATION 5

From a technical point of view it has big problems both from the graphic point of view (it looks like a game of two generations ago) and from the performance point of view (the continuous drop in frames is unnerving). Incredible AI is also lost with NPCs and some bosses. The gameplay remains solid and clean. The last downside and perhaps the worst is the total recycling of assets as if it were a copy and paste.

qwerty17771,"'When you've finished your 4th Black Forest gateau - here, have another, and try not to puke' Putting 5-10 hours into this game gave me both a skinking sense of deja-vu and the feeling of forcing myself to eat **** of overly sweet cake. If, like me, you have played this series since Demon's Souls, you will realise Elden Ring is Dark Souls 4. Or Demon's Souls 2 - It doesn't really matter at this point. Other than the *slightly* more open world structure (the 'Souls series was always somewhat open in structure) and Torrent the goathorse, everything is exactly the same as all the previous games, including elements from Bloodborne and Sekiro. Same player classes and animations? Same enemy design, including enemy types/classes? Same pseudo-mediaeval world, with lonely atmosphere? Same dead-eyed, hollow-voiced NPCs? Same controls and combat system? Same telling of the opaque story and world lore through item descriptions? Same, boring, grindy progression system? Same die-and-die-again repetitive gameplay? Enroaching feeling that you are wasting your life playing updates to the same game released well over a decade ago? 'Yes' to all of the above. Mashing together your previous 4 games and adding a horse is in no way innovative or good, by any metric. This is one of the laziest 'masterpieces' I have ever seen. It used to be fun, but its just the same bland thing over and over again. Utterly sickening - i hope you like cake. And then more cake. After a palate cleanser of cake. All washed down with a warm glass of cake, chewed up and regurgitated into a pint glass by Hidetaka Miyazaki.",4,2022-02-28,PLAYSTATION 5

Casualgamer99,"Siamo onesti. Se lo confrontiamo con i giochi from, è effettivamente un gioco da 9. Anche confrontandolo con i giochi from non darei 10 perché a mio avviso bloodborn era ancora più ispirato, non che elden ring non lo sia. Detto ciò, essendo che nel mondo video ludico non ci sono solo i giochi From la valutazione deve essere differente. Soprattutto considerando l’enorme mole di giochi open world disponibili. Il mondo è estremamente statico, nemmeno la vegetazione reagisce minimamente al passaggio del PG, cosa non da PlayStation 4 ma da PlayStation 3. Il mondo se non per la presenza di mostri (a volte molto ispirati e comunque presenti in grande varietà) è totalmente morto e vuoto. Tecnicamente parlando siamo di fronte a un gioco a inizio generazione PlayStation 4, non ci passo sopra “perché è From”, sopratutto considerando il frame rate instabile in un gioco di questo tipo. Tralasciando il reparto tecnico insufficiente, ci sono state belle innovazioni nel combattimento come ceneri e il salto. Ma si tira dietro i classici problemi della saga. Hitbox imprecise, animazioni legnose e imprecise. Con animazioni imprecise intendo che per fare un parry l’unica cosa da fare è imparare a memoria il tempismo andando a tentativi. Perché in base al nemico il tempismo cambia ma non segue l’animazione. Quindi abbiamo un sistema di combattimento difficile NON per una AI particolarmente efficace e per un combattimento estremamente tecnico e profondo, ma semplicemente perché non è fatto come si deve. Anche perché è un sistema di combattimento abbastanza basilare. Reparto creativo eccellente, bellissimo a livello artistico. E per chi piace, ottima anche la “narrativa”. In sostanza, come gioco From gioco da 9, come gioco nel mondo reale dove esiste la concorrenza e le altre case di sviluppo, oltre al 7 questo titolo non merita.",7,2022-02-28,PLAYSTATION 5

The level of detail and reward for exploration is insane. I haven't felt this rewarded and engaged to explore in an open world game in a long long time. All of my friends are playing it as well and we each discuss these entirely different experiences following whatever path we want. If you're worried about a difficult experience it certainly is hard, but the freedom to just run off and do something else will help make it that much more bearable. To go prepare for another try.

NextGenGamer,"I'm 35 hours in, and I am completely blown away. The only thing more fun than the time I've put in is knowing just how much more content there is left to explore. I don't often leave reviews for games, but when I saw some of the review-bombing that the PS5 version of Elden Ring is getting on here, I figured I had to say my piece. First off, there are clearly tons of people who are on the wrong page and don't realize it. The PC port is not very well done and I won't say anything to defend it, but to come to the PS5 listing and complain about PC frame rate issues, lack of ultrawide support and other issues that clearly have nothing to do with PS5 is extremely dishonest. If you removed all of the negative reviews that have been clearly left on the wrong page, the score would be like 10 points higher. It's a shame that people can outright post that they are reviewing the wrong game as part of their review feedback, and that review just stays up and potentially affects other's opinions. I think Metacritic should remove reviews that are posted to the wrong platform. That aside, the game is astonishing. The folks saying that the open world is flat or empty must be playing a completely different game than I am. You can barely run for 30 seconds before finding something interesting. I am probably not even a third into the game and I have found so many things that have surprised and intrigued me that I have lost count. Some assets (like catacombs) are re-configured and re-used, but when maybe 4 out of the 100+ points of interest I've found are re-configured, that is completely okay with me. As for the folks who are saying that this game is re-using assets (animations etc.) as a form of criticism, I think they are being completely unrealistic. For a game of this magnitude to exist, that was a tool that FromSoft had which made it possible in the first place. They have a pile of animation rigs, AI and other assets from other games they have published on this engine, and it seems to me that their swan song for that robust engine is to take all of the best from it and use it (plus countless new assets) to build a gargantuan game which would not otherwise be possible, and to give an incredible amount of content to players who enjoy the material FromSoft creates. I suspect that the hype, mostly by gaming news sites with reviewers that have come to love FromSoft games, has led to many new folks picking up Elden Ring who have not played other FromSoft games and have no idea what they are getting into. That clearly shows in some of the reviews that are listing series staples as design flaws. In short, the PS5 version of this game is the way to go, and it runs perfectly. The graphics are fantastic considering the unimaginable scope of this game, and the gameplay is perfect. Go explore, get lost, get killed, get lost somewhere else, get stronger and come back to get revenge. This game is truly open-ended, and everything is possible right from the start. It feels like being dropped into a living, breathing world with endless mysteries to unravel. If that sounds cool to you, you will enjoy this game.",10,2022-02-28,PLAYSTATION 5
Centrifikal,"Technical issues can be fixed. I rate games based on content. Fromsoft is above and beyond the masters of combat oriented rpgs.

I was in an underground area and it had the best look of any game I have ever seen to date. Period. Combine that with an upgraded combat system and it feels sublime. I have 2 great runes and I am just taking my time with the rest of the bosses. I want to find everything I can. The amount of mini bosses is amazing as well. So many cool encounters. I cant say enough about this game. On the technical side I noticed frame rate drops. That is it and I can forgive that. This game is worth buying. Just take your time and explore.

If you want a game that requires you to THINK and OVERCOME CHALLENGE, this is the game for you.

Just for these reasons and the fact that I am addicted, I rate this game 10/10. The PS5 optimization is poor and the graphics are nothing exceptional, I hope PS5 optimization gets patched (even in framerate priorisation mode, there are many framerate drops and graphics often popup, such as grass).

J-Stony,"Before getting started, let it be known that I have played every FromSoftware game since Demon's Souls. I did not play King's Field or Armored Core. So in this review, when I am talking about the Soulsborne series, know it begins with Demon's Souls and ends with Sekiro. I was saddened when Miyazaki said he wouldn't be making any more games in the Dark Souls franchise. From Demon's Souls to Dark Souls 3, I felt that these games were just fantastic. I loved going in and out of different areas, using different builds, summoning other players/NPCs, and even doing a spot of PvP. I didn't know how I would move on not being able to play such a great series. Fast forward a little to Sekiro. I have not beaten Sekiro, but I do enjoy it. It is still installed, and I give it a shot every few weeks. The main issue with that game, or mainly myself, is that I am simply not good at parrying. Sekiro requires A LOT of parrying. That is not to say that it is a bad game by any means. Eventually, I will overcome the challenge of beating it. Still, it definitely did not bring me in like Bloodborne, and Dark Souls 3 did. Bloodborne and Dark Souls 3 are by far two of my favorite games to come out on PS4. I think I went through the entire system's life cycle with both of those games still installed to this day. People do their own prerogative with their money, but these games are not meant for one-time play-throughs. I encourage players to play through them even today with a different build than before and explore what these games really have to offer. Because that is where the love for these games lie. Now we move to Friday, February 25th, 2022. I did not know what to expect from Elden Ring. After being out of the FromSoftware games for a while now, since I did not play a lot of Sekiro, I was skeptical of even buying it on day one. As the release day got closer, I would see new videos showing what the game had to offer. I started to see a resemblance to Dark Souls 3, giving me the go-ahead to pick it up and play another Soulsborne game. I am glad I did this very thing. I didn't know how they would put a Soulsborne game into an open-world genre, but man, have they delivered. FromSoftware shows gamers that they can make an excellent, open, and unending game set in this genre. Reading the tutorial messages on the ground and fighting the weak enemy battles through the tutorial zone, I was definitely back in the saddle again (settle down, Steven Tyler). You open the final door and are revealed the gloriousness of Limgrave. Many reviews say this game looks like ""PS3 graphics"" or ""no accessibility"" for new players. I'm sorry, you must be new here. FromSoftware has always stuck to its guns on delivering challenging games. No one seemed to be this upset about Dark Souls 3 or Sekiro. Maybe this game had more hype than a usual FromSoftware game, but to say it is ""not welcoming to new players"" is such a waste of breath. All games are not made for everybody. For instance, Fortnite/Apex Legends are not accessible because every week, there is something new and garbage in my book. However, I am not going around making a big stink about it. The slogan, ""mad cause bad,"" definitely sticks here, and to review bomb something because you keep dying is not a good discussion for anyone. Does Elden Ring have some flaws? Absolutely it does, but they have also doubled up on the quality of life things, like fast travel and the abundance of fast travel spots, or Sites of Grace. Do you know how nice it would have been to have a bonfire 10 steps from a boss door? Me neither. Another complaint I am seeing is the lack of hidden secrets on corners of the map. I watched a video of a popular streamer rage at there not being something on the corner of a map. I don't recall Breath of the Wild or Skyrim doing that either. This is exploration in a nutshell. If you find something in every nook and cranny, then the items you do find are not going to be as worth it. Am I biased to this series? Absolutely, but I call out bad things in games I enjoy too. I have not even started the PvP side of things yet. That could lead to the ""2-second"" lag that the PvP in these games has always had, which drives me nuts and is why I do not play it competitively. If you swing your weapons at me and roll, I shouldn't take damage from that swing two seconds later. We will see how that side of things plays out, as I won't dive into PvP until usually on my second play-through. In summary, FromSoftware delivers on an open-world Soulsborne game, especially when many games coming out cannot capitalize on the open-world aspect. It would be a 9 out of 10, but I found two greatswords and have dual-wielded them now, and that in itself is worth another point. Thanks for reading",10,2022-02-28,PLAYSTATION 5

I waited with great anticipation for this game for nearly 4 years since its announcement, and my high hopes and expectations were not just met but exceeded. These games are not for everyone, and Elden Ring is not an exception just because it's open-world. But for me, I'd infinitely prefer a game like Elden Ring over something like Assassin's Creed (No hate, just not for me). To me, this is the closest thing to the perfect ARPG out there - my only complaints are with the performance issues on PC. Unstable framerate, crashes, and invisible enemies in the open world - I've experienced all of these and they're not so minor as to not deserve scrutiny. I only docked 1 point for these issues because the rest of the game is so strong to me, and offers such a colossal amount of content, that I want to express how good the actual game is at a glance.",9,2022-02-28,PLAYSTATION 5

Frame rate drops DO happen, but for me it only ever on torrent ( the horse ) moving quickly in dense areas. This IS a souls game, souls combat, souls spells, souls layouts and souls brutality ( Unless you choose astrologer or build into cheesorceries ). Having said that they have greatly expanded on what you would call the souls game foundation. The open world is huge, very very dense and unique as hell. The bosses are amazing. It's just a huge open world souls game adventure.

Onion-Knight11,"I would love to play and review this game but as of 28th February 2022 the game is unplayable. I am in Thailand and bought the pre-order of Elden Ring on PS4. I downloaded it and when I played the game, I found that the game was in ""Mainland Chinese Language"". No problem, I can change the language to ""English"". I was suprised that I could not do that. The game is only available in Chinese, Korean and Thai. What? What happened? In the SEA Region, the game has a ""Region Lock"" on its languages. This is not a Elden Ring problem but this is a Sony problem that affects Elden Ring gameplay. The only way I can play an english version of this game is to buy the game (again) on a US PSN account and then play it in my asian account. I do not desire to buy the game again when the game I did buy works perfectly fine (except the language lock). This is 2022, games should have an english language option no matter the region.

DevynL,"Being my first “Souls” game, I’ve thoroughly enjoyed myself so far. The game starts out in an open world that is yours to explore. The leveling system is great, combat is exemplary, and the graphics are beautiful. There’s not a single part of the game that doesn’t have unique terrain, enemies, or a breathtaking view. The enemies are expectedly hard, and all unique to their regards. Even if an enemy is overwhelming, you can always leave to level up and come back when you have better gear. Being able to hop into your buddy’s world or vice versa, and taking on areas/bosses add a whole other level of enjoyability. There’s something about teaming up on a boss that gives you hell and taking them from different angles with your friends that makes it that much more fun. I currently have 40 hours in the game, and still have 60+ more to go easily. So far, it’s been an incredible experience and it’s hard to put the controller down. I can’t wait to traverse more of the endless lands, and encounter even more incredible enemy’s.",10,2022-02-28,PLAYSTATION 5

I tried Demon Souls remake on PS5 and as much as I enjoyed it I also quit. I thought Elden Ring was the one the one souls-like that would pull me in and let me sing its praises from a mountain top. Unfortunately I cannot do that and I must say this is not the Masterpiece many claim it to be. Don't get me wrong this is a great game! But let's not get ahead of ourselves it's not perfect nowhere near perfect in fact. I absolutely love the exploration in Elden Ring the most and discovering whatever might my over that ridge line or what might be hidden within a dark cave or tomb somewhere. The armor and weapons look cool as f*** and the world the game is set in certain is interesting. Unfortunately for me, graphically it looks like a game from 2015 and the controls/combat still doesn't feel very tight which only made it more difficult to a guy who **** at Souls-Like games. Edit: as of March 5 2022 - I kept playing and I am now obsessed with Elden Ring. I believe I have finally managed to get over the learning curve at least for a beginner and see what the fuss is about with these Souls-like games.

Maus8991,"Eng/Ita The souls evolution that we needed, in an open world gameplay whit lots of secret that gift the player whit new objects that evolve your possibilities . We have semplification mixed whit evolution too from dark souls like the ashes of war that let you add a unic move on your weapon and change the ability scaling of that weapon so the player has a big freedom to play as he like. The boss fight are amazing, even the secondary , the environment are huge and different, filled whit secrets that expand your gameplay, and the style of the world take inspiration from all the from software game but having a own soul that distinguish Elden ring from his predecessor . The main problem for me was the difficulty wich start pretty easy and than slap your face whit the first big boss fight of the game which is much harder than anything you have met before in the game, but teaching you whit brute force how the new gameplay is and telling you to use everything you have to win. Graphics is that of an old gen game, not amazing but still good since the game is not an exclusive for one console and need to run on every platform My true vote is 9/10 but I give 10/10 for the dumb people review bombing whitout even playing the game L’evoluzione al gameplay souls che serviva in salsa open world, con numerosi segreti che premiano donando oggetti che ampliano sempre di più le possibilità del giocatore, insieme a semplificazioni per variare il proprio gameplay tramite le numerose ceneri di guerra che oltre ad aggiungere una mossa diversa per ognuna cambiano lo scaling o il tipo di danno per l’arma. Le Boss fight sono magnifiche , comprese quelle secondarie e ambientazioni varie che passano dall’inquietante all’onirico, unendo elementi presenti in dark soul, bloodborne e sekiro ma aggiungendo una propria anima all’interno. La pecca principale è la curva di difficoltà che è fin troppo ripida passando da relativamente semplice nei primi momenti fino all’incontro con il primo boss importante che invece è una terapia d’urto al nuovo stile di gameplay che spinge il giocatore ad usare tutto quello che ha a propria disposizione e che l’open world ti dona. La grafica è quella di un videogioco old gen ma considerando la necessità di girare su qualsiasi piattaforma è comunque un buon risultato Lascio 10/10 solo per le recensioni dei frustrati che non lo hanno nemmeno giocato ma il mio voto sarebbe 9/10",10,2022-02-28,PLAYSTATION 5

Asrael5125,"FromSoftware have outdone themselves. The open world gameplay is fantastic and builds upon a design philosophy that rewards curiosity, creativity and the player's determination to overcome obstacles. The world is filled with things to discover and since there are no markers on the map that instantly spoil any feeling of adventure, the lands between feel even more big and mysterious than they actually are. The difficulty forces the player to use every item and skill that is available to them and utilize them in creative ways. It might be frustrating, especially for new players who may not see the possibility to strengthen their characters before returning to an enemy that seemed too hard previously. There's always a organic difficulty setting inside of the game's mechanics, that lets players choose how hard an encounter should be. I don't want to make this too long and most of the things have already been said. What makes this game special are the small and epic moments that truly feel like the player's on an adventure through a unique and mysterious world that is designed with the craftsmanship of true masters of their work.",10,2022-02-28,PLAYSTATION 5

saito200a,"I'm reading the negative reviews, and wondering if (besides performance issues, of which I have none) and asking myself ""did this people play the same game I did?"". The criticism they do is the opposite of what this game actually is. One review said that the world looked bleak and repetitive. Wow... it is the exact opposite. Maybe they played for just 20 minutes?? I played for 35 hours. I didn't even complete 1/3 of the game. At every turn I am astonished of how incredible the world looks. Build diversity seems huge. Soloing bosses is actually hard. Boss mechanics are one of the most creative I've seen in any Souls game. Multiplayer is greatly improved compared to past souls games. Basically, this is Dark Souls definitive edition and then some more, in a very well executed open world. Every open world area feels utterly distinct. Jeez, I have no idea how anyone can say ""every area looks bleak and repetitive"". It is striking how distinctive each area is. Maybe they were playing another game and didn't notice. Also, area traversal is a puzzle in itself, since there are lots of huge vertical slopes. That prevents one from just rushing through a zone and favors exploration. This game is mindbowingly amazing. I would give it an 11 if I could. I've never played anything even remotely close to this in terms of how good it is. That doesn't mean everyone would love this game since some people are just not into souls games, might find it too hard or that it takes too much time, or just not into fantasy settings. But then no game is meant to please all the crowds, but rather one specific crowd very well.",10,2022-02-28,PLAYSTATION 5

adamnshame,"They have taken the winning formula of their previous games: breath-taking varied locations, a ridiculous range of enemies, difficult but rewarding combat, and way too much choice, then added even more choice. The game world is truly spectacular, with each environment being beautiful in its own way. I'm about 15 bosses in and they're exactly what I'd expect from a Soulsborne game so no complaints there. The combat is as good as their other games, but feels fresh and more customisable with additions like ashes of war, spirit ashes, the wondrous physick flask, and cracked/other pots. The thing that really sets this game apart is the endless variety of the world, there is a ridiculous amount of meaningful, distinct content.

The boss’s are difficult but not blatantly unfair and there is great variety amongst them and normal enemies. I chose to go as prisoner as my class as the sorceries are extremely fun to use. The melee conbat is brilliant because of the depth it has and how many different weapons and Ashes of war to chose from The performance on the PS5 version I have been playing could be improved but doesn’t take away too much of my enjoyment. The Legend of Zelda Breath of the Wild set the mark for what an open world game should be and Elden Ring has built upon those stepping stones and improved upon it. It has surpassed Breath of the Wild in my opinion, but botw is still an absolutely brilliant game and still one of the best.

So I thought oh it's because it's just not optimized for PS5 so I got it on PC too and no. It did not look any better and ran even worse. My second problem with the game is how bland the open world is.

This game claims to be an open world game yet still there werent chances to feel that it actually is. Vastness of map became an stress and frustration since most of monsters you encounter are just the repetition of previous series. Even character's attacking motions are just same. Why would I have to suffer through this stressful world given that only reward is to feel the same thing in previous DS series? Elden Ring is playable on next gen console but graphic is just the same as DS 3 with only a little bit of upgrade. I see no progress on graphics when compared to another triple A games and this game got 97 out of 100 from critics?

Mattone_Merlo,"I am 25 hours into the game and I want more and more and more. Being a player who usually likes to rush games filled with useless content, it IS something when a game convinces me that it is worth losing hours and hours looking for the smallest details hidden here and there. Elden Ring is kind of everything you have already seen in other Miyazaki games put together in a very smart way, plus an incredible blend of open world landscape and intelligent level design. Legacy dungeons are just what you would expect from a From Software game, with an added dimension of verticality and an even more complex construction, while outside the dungeons you have a vast world full of secrets and dangers (with respective rewards). After 15 hours I went back to the first area and found A LOT of things left to do, and none of them were boring or useless (unlike most open world games). The only problems are really ""just"" technical. I hope they will be solved soon enough, but it IS quite a scandal that a cross-gen game does not run properly on any platform. On horse there is massive pop-in, as well as when you respawn, and frame drops are far from being rare even in performance mode. At least, I found there is less input lag and much faster loadings (thanks to PS5 SSD). Dying is less painful now that you can respawn in less than 5 seconds.",9,2022-02-28,PLAYSTATION 5

RoryBlank,"I love this game so far. Last year to challenge myself, I decided to play Demon's Souls, Dark Souls 1, 2, and 3, Bloodborne, and Sekiro back to back, having not played any of them before, as a challenge. At first it seemed impossibly difficult, and I thought I had made a terrible mistake, but eventually something clicked in my head and I understood. Thinking of the games as being punishingly difficult is a miscategorization of what they are doing. They are, more than anything, trying to get you to play them on their own terms, rather than your own. In. a way, it felt like learning to play Tony Hawk Pro Skater. It wanted something very specific from me, that wasn't exactly in my wheelhouse, but once I started to pay attention to what it was asking, the games opened up to me. Elden Ring feels like the culmination of every experiment, every idea that the studio has tried from Demon's Souls onward. The levels are some of the most polished, most fully realized they have ever produced. The bosses are cool and unique, the overworld feels full of possibility and excitement. I also think it's the most fair and giving game that they've produced of this kind. If you feel stuck on something, there are hundreds of other areas to explore, and lower level enemies to fight and gain experience and hone your skills on, rather than being stuck in 1-2 places, or going through the paces of farming for xp or resources in an old spot. If you don't like it, that's fine, it doesn't have to be for you, but personally I love it, and if you're trying the game and feel like you might have made a mistake, I would ask, before you give it up and write it off, just take some time to go explore. See what you find. Try doing something different, experiment with a different build. There's a lot of opportunity in this game, if you go looking for it.",10,2022-02-28,PLAYSTATION 5

Antonio37282,"This game seems to have the community split in half, just like Dark Souls 2 and Sekiro before it. And I am glad to be on the side of the community that enjoys **** far it’s the best souls game I’ve played,and I’ve played all of them. The open world, the OST , the weapons , the everything. Also the sheer quality of the bosses.I think I’m in love But you’ve already read lots of praises so let’s talk about the downsides of the game. So far it’s optimization is not perfect on ps5(I hear it’s a lot worse on pc) but I am sure it will be fixed. I don’t get people who give bad ratings to the game just because it stutters. Jeez it’s been two days until release ,have some patience. It’s graphics are mediocre for a GOTY contender. I’d give it 6/10 or 7/10 . TBH i didn’t really expect this game to be the best looking game, but it doesn’t by any means look bad. People saying it looks like a ps3 game are simply ridiculous. The part that left me with a sour taste in my mouth( I wouldn’t say dissapointed because I already suspected it might be this way) is that it didn’t really bring too many changes on the previous combat sytems of the game. I would be nice if the combat had more touches of sekiro and bloodborne,not just dark souls, and also add the three types of dodging( rolling like dark souls,sidestepping like sekiro and dashing like bloodborne) and make them depend on equip burden and armor The combat system is still a masterpiece ,but maybe it’s mechanics are perhaps a bit,old? Otherwise the world is great , the bosses are masterpieces and the combat system is still fun and addictive and the lore is fabulous.",10,2022-02-28,PLAYSTATION 5
LagMaster,"Elden is probably if not definitely the best game produced by FromSoftware and possibly one of the best games of all time. The content is vast and worth the money but for those not prepared for the challenges that come with the game, I would not recommend it as it takes some effort and learning to beat the game. However, while the game can be extremely difficult at times the game provides ways and means to overcome these difficulties without holding the players hands through every step. While the graphics are almost the same as ps4, everything else in the game compensates for it. The world is huge full of sites not usually found in any other game as the world feels built from scratch and the environment is specially built based on that. While the world is huge, it is not littered with meaningless quests and areas which makes almost every discovery meaningful and not like a chore. While battling on horseback need a bit of getting used to and learning, the overall horseback mechanics are almost excellent and smooth without it feeling too clunky or restrictive. The game is excellent and challenging with a vast open world and content that feels like it never runs out but does not feel like a chore hence continues to give a sense of adventure from the beginning to the very end of the game.",10,2022-02-28,PLAYSTATION 5

Chensa,"Calling this game a must play is just wrong. The overall critic rating is a result of about 50 hardcore souls-fans that are willing to ignore many, many issues and only focus on the thrill of endless boss fights (admittedly - definitely thrilling). But this game is so far from perfect. In terms of visuals and performance - it is very far from next gen. The animations, the frame rate, the pop-in. The world almost never responds to the player. I like the art style but next to games like Guardians or the Galaxy or Horizon ll it looks like a sharper PS4 game at best. Some weapons are good but the overall combat system is unbalanced. Story is told in very lazy way but no one cares about that. Enemy design (especially bosses of course) is often brilliant and the music is fantastic. The open world is fun to explore but to stay it's revolutionary is far from the truth imo. The only things that makes this game so exciting is chemistry in your brain. The thrill of defeating a giant boss is amazing, and the hard, fixed difficulty is what makes every encounter so intense. Same for exploration and the sense of constant danger. It's no wonder that From Software refused to add an easy mode. Without the sense of accomplishment after beating a boss, without the constant fear and sense of danger, this game has almost nothing to offer, and it's definitely not a next-gen, must play title.",5,2022-02-28,PLAYSTATION 5

This game is incredible, the performance issues have been massively overexaggerated by what I can only assume are people who are more upset that the game does not look and or feel like your cookie cutter ubisoft open world where everything is spelled out so that a 5 year old could follow along.There are frame drops every now and then I'll admit, but you will not notice half the time cause there so minor, plus you'll be to busy exploring/fighting in a world so beautiful and cared for you won't mind. Also others seem to be saying that this game is empty, devoid, and samey. This could not be further from the truth, it's painfully obvious that many of these players made it 2 hours in a gave up. As for me I have play around 30 hours and have discovered probably 30% of the map, crawled countless dungeons, fought epic bosses, listened to exceptional music, and had the most fun I've ever had whilst gaming. To see this getting trashed is a travesty to game design. This is a technical marvel, a game of our generation, to sit there and get butt hurt cause the graphics aren't Horizon Forbidden West is an insult. Ask yourself is the game fun, and if the answer is yes who gives a flip( btw the game is beautiful). I am also hearing these same players complain about there being no story with is absolutely absurd, because it literally gives you lore and story with every character and boss and environment you meet. Do not be swayed by these crybabies who need there hands held while they take a dump. BUY THIS GAME if it's the only game you ever get, if your not a mental reject you will understand why this is one of the greatest games of our generation. #thanksforcomingtomytedtalk",10,2022-02-28,PLAYSTATION 5

rezajimba,"My entire experience for this game so far is purchasing it in PSN Asia, downloading it, and opening the game only to find out that all the subtitles & entire User Interface is locked on Chinese, Thai, and/or Korean language. I cannot even read or begin understand what I'm seeing on the Title Screen. I don't understand why you have a game with English Audio but everything else is locked to be not English. I've seen players resorting to the use of Google Camera to translate every screen but the players don't deserve such hassle for a game they paid for. The game clearly stated that it supported English Language during the pre-release. It is strange how any other game supports multi-language but a major title from Fromsoftware would lock languages based on region. I am not playing this game unless an English Pack is added nor will I purchase an English version of the game from Western PSN store and double the profit of those who made this decision. It is unreasonable that you would lock the Language based on region. NOT EVERYONE THAT PURCHASES FROM PSN ASIA ARE CHINESE, THAI, OR KOREAN.

TylerC,"For anyone who has played a Souls game before and enjoyed it, this is an absolutely massive open world full of adventure, intricate level design, wild boss fights, trippy landscapes, and trademark bizarro storytelling. Absolutely mind-blowing. For first-timers: Yes, these games have a learning curve, and admittedly it may not seem so fun the first several hours while you're learning how to fight. Focus on discovery, pick easier fights, and ease your way in. These games are like learning to drive a manual transmission - it's a pain at first, but once you pass that threshold of learning it becomes so satisfying and fun it's hard to imagine going back to automatic (or to a typical game with button mashing combat and cheesy Hollywood narrative). Many of the negative reviews seem to obsess over performance issues but I have played 40 hours and never experienced anything affecting my playthrough. Many others seem to be posting negative user reviews without having played much of the game, possibly as a reaction to all the positive critic reviews. These games aren't for everyone, but if you judge the game by it's artistic merits it really is something special.",10,2022-02-27,PLAYSTATION 5

If you are a fan of normal to easy games then this is not your game. 2- The frame rate is not 60 but it is always above 30 so you won't experience any lag or something like that. 3- The graphic and design of the game are totally different from soul games.

Boss fights are unrewarding and feel like a chore to complete. Having completed all the souls game it is by far the worst entry in terms of boss fight. For about 90% of them Im falling asleep with my controller on my lap mechanically spamming the dodge button waiting for the 700 lbs guy to finish his acrobatic routine so that I can finally get a single hit in and then immediatly back away (rince and repeat about 20 times until he is dead). Gaming journalist need to stop taking from software as the holy grail of gaming, this game is good but giving it a 97% is false advertisement. User’s score is a lot more fair and reflecting of it.

All of the new mechanics and quality of life improvements that fromsoft has added are welcome additions! Do NOT be fooled by the bad reviews. These are people that are upset that it has yet to be optimized as well for PC. Yes, it does run into problems on PC at times. This does not make it anything less than what it is. The developers are aware of the problem and are working on a patch. Japanese games are often less optimized on PC. This game is definitely more accessible than other souls titles but still expect it to be very challenging at the least, and at most VERY difficult.I still recommend this game to anyone who loves great action or JRPGs, as you would be hard pressed to find a better game in those categories.",10,2022-02-27,PLAYSTATION 5

ZeeManCan,"I see on the first few days of launch that the user reviews are pretty low. I know that the game has has a rough launch on PC. But aside from that, i predicted this: There was a huge hype train for this game. A big tornado of hype created by the Souls community, Youtubers looking for views and gaming media talking about this game like it was the 2nd coming of Jesus himself. This Hype tornado **** in a bunch of players who never played a souls game in their lives and because of that, many of these people were expecting a Next Gen experience with Graphics and gameplay akin to what God Of War 2 will look like. That's what happens when the hype train gets carried away. It happened with CyberPunk and it happened with Elden Ring. But the major difference is, Cyberpunk was the developers fault, and Elden Ring was the fault of the people who didnt do more research on what kind of game they were really getting into I have a handful of friends who I've tried convincing to play a Dark Souls game for the last 10 years and they wouldn't. And now all of a sudden they all wanna play Elden Ring. Well, sorry to the folks who were thinking they were about to get a naughty dog mixed with Elder Scrolls by Bethesda experience. You get exactly what we fans over the last 10 years have been asking for. A LARGER more fulfilled vision of the Dark Souls Universe and it is absolutely stunning and beautiful. If you haven't played a FromSoftware Souls-Like game before, ask yourself this: ""Am i ready to play a game that doesn't hold my hand, challenges me and will give me no choice but to google stuff a bunch through my playthrough? Am i ready for a type of game I've never played before, one that rewards patience and persistence but always gives me a way to solve problems presented?"" This is a nerds game. And if you wanna be a gaming nerd like the rest of us, you're more than welcome to join us. If you're new and dont know where to start, check out VaatiVidya on Youtube. He's everyones go-to for Youtubers who cover FromSoftware content. For the rest of you though, God of War 2 and Starfield come out later this year, just hold on until then. Elden Ring is a perfect accumulation of all of FromSoftwares 6 previous Souls and Souls-Like games. They took the formula and perfected it. I'm 20 hours in and i feel like i just started getting into the thick of it. This is a must play for anyone up to the challenge/know what there getting into.

yalldumb,"I honestly can't believe some of these negative reviews. I assume maybe it's people new to Dark Souls games? It's not meant to be a rockstar game. It's a massive JRPG with deep combat, inventory, statistics and upgrades. My dog could beat Red Dead 2. This is not meant to be that. For what it's worth, I have only played 20 hours but I am deeply enchanted by the world they have created. The graphics are improved from DS3, in my opinion they are incredible. The enemies are insanely varied and detailed, and I am amazed at how well they blended the open world with the classic Dark Souls level designs for dungeons and smaller areas. I have loved every moment, and if you get good, you will too.",10,2022-02-27,PLAYSTATION 5
Rathial,"This has been my favorite game in such a long long time. Honestly the open world + dark souls style is amazing so many things to do. While I have only had the game for a couple days I've already put roughly 40 hours into the game and there still feels like there is a ton left to complete. There has been a ton of QOL changes and new additions which makes the game better and arguably easier than previous titles. HOWEVER, there is still plenty of amazing, challenging, and fun bosses all over. I don't know the exact number but I'm already about 60 bosses in and while some are basic bosses a lot are really cool. I've been playing on a midtier PC that I bought last Black Friday and I haven't had any real issues with the game frame rate or lag. I am only playing on medium settings though because I don't want to nuke my pc since it's really nothing special lol While the majority of the game isn't really too difficult there are some bosses that may take a while to beat. I'm giving this a 10 simply because I cannot remember the last time I played a game anywhere near this good. I can't say it's a perfect game since I haven't 100% it yet but it truly is amazing.",10,2022-02-27,PLAYSTATION 5

Technically not my first souls game, only had played Demon’s Souls, and I couldn’t enjoy dying al the time on the same spot, so I dropped it very early Demon’s Souls.

The graphics are what you would expect in a from software game. Which means it’s reusing the same old formula with very little innovation. Though some mechanics like jumping and riding a horse is different, it felt like an expansion to dark souls and not something I wish I would have spent $60 on. The instability is the biggest issue and I can’t get past it.

Also its a painful experience some of you I know enjoy a game that is difficult but some of us just want to plug in for a couple hours occasionally and enjoy ourselves this game is another one of those were if you want to enjoy the game you better grind things out for a month leveling up your character so that every encounter does not end immediately in your death. I know it sounds like I am bashing the game but I am not I do enjoy it but it just **** because this could have been no very much better with just a few tweaks.

Wuggle,"As an older player (the big 50) who has put countless hours into Demon Souls, Darks Souls Remastered and Dark Souls 3 and who considers Dark Souls 3 to be my favourite game of all time I have to say after about 20 hours into Elden Ring that this game is highly likely to claim the throne from Dark Souls 3. I appreciate if you are not into the Souls series as much as me you may want to come on here and give it a negative review especially if you are new to having a game not hold your hand and funnel you down a map full of quests in a logical order. This game expects you to be brave, explore, die (many times) and learn. It is not a game for some but, unlike being burnt by professional reviewers in the past for games such as Cyberpunk I can confirm they are spot on with their reviews for Elden Ring. This is a game changer for the Souls series and my definite GOTY unless I get blindsided by something else truly amazing though I highly doubt that is likely to happen. Anyway, a perfect 10 from me and just ignore the haters who probably played for a few hours and dismissed the game because the systems are purposely not as intuitive as mainstream games and they got their asses beaten before rage quitting. The only negatives are perhaps the frame rate issues I experienced on PC but on the console, I'm very happy with it and I'm sure there will still be patches there in time. Certainly no major bugs like other open world games on release.... I think FromSoftware have released an amazing well polished product that I'm sure will only get better with time... other developers should take note!",10,2022-02-27,PLAYSTATION 5

Those worried about the difficulty have to realize that yes this is a hard game, but it is still possible to beat. There is an aura about souls games that tend to stop casual gamers from trying it out, which shouldn't happen, because anyone can beat these games.

Rising333,"Bottom line: the game is overhyped. I have been playing From Soft games since Kings Field 1. Design: This is more of the same, and absolutely just dark souls in an open world. It is refreshing to see a game without a bunch of icon chasing and relies on player exploration. One caveat and problem here is that the payoff when clearing out extremely tough areas is nonexistent, often times rewarding you with mediocre items, this is the same for slightly hidden items, they are just mediocre save for a few instances. The sense of exploration created by their design choices are great, what you get for exploring isn't, but still, it's a fun challenge. It works from a design standpoint, but as a fan I'm tired of being sold the same decade old game engine ALONG with re used enemy animations, assets, and move sets. The armors, weapons, all of it are literal reskins they have already used across 4 games. The least from soft could do is update the archaic UI. Technical: The game runs poorly on PS5, there new patch 1.002.001 actually made the game WORSE. with a shorter draw distance and more pop in, but the framerate is still as bad as before, and now the game looks and runs worse. Bottom Line: this game as is technically, is not what the mainstream outlets are saying. It's a technically flawed dark souls game set in an open world. If the technical issues were actually fixed on this game reusing so much content from old games, I'd say it's a solid 8. Just don't go in buying the nonsense about a masterpiece and accessibility to all. It's a lie.",5,2022-02-27,PLAYSTATION 5

Im 43 years old and been playing video games since 1983. My favorite game of all time was original Demon’s Souls. I never liked open works games because they felt empty of good design and memorable moments. To me, this is the best game ever created. Wow! It’s like the best moments of Demon’s Souls over and over and over again. But new?! How do they come up with all this. Seriously, all other open world games - play this and learn from the masters. Answers to some weird bad reviews: No problem with frame drops on my PS5. You can choose between FPS or quality mode!

Would this be one of those ""play for 5 mins and realize it's not my thing and get a refund"" I wondered. 5 hours later, I was still grinding away and killed my first boss It does take a good amount of time to get good at the game and understand the combat mechanics. At the start, it's going to feel like you're never going to be able to kill anything other than trash. But if you keep at it and invest your runes and ashes wisely, you'll be rewarded. I've played games that are huge open worlds but the actual playable area is small and you get nothing for exploring except nice views. Elden Ring gives you the nice view and has rewards to go with it. I love that you can always across caves or a bandit camps with plenty of loot. The game is harsh but also rewarding! This is definitely a buy from me! Except if you're someone who prefers games that get to the point from the start and are mission focused.

Sunlit,"People rating this game lower than a 8 wouldn’t know good game design if it but them right in their tarnished. I saw one review saying “the open world lacks any creativity”. Compared to what? I can’t think of a single other piece of any medium, movie, game, music or otherwise, with as much strange, gross and abstract creativity as this game. I’ve seen people down there saying, “the open world is empty, and lacks in quality”, saying that camps are randomly splayed out with enemies. Did you play the game for more than an hour? Judging by the fact that you posted your review an hour after the game came out I’m gunna guess no. I’ve never seen an open world game have so many different types of enemies interesting npcs with mysterious side quests they don’t just waypoint you to, crazy enemy battles, and as hugely diverse set of locations as this game. And camps and castles always have an item in them that will help you, and you’ll need it because this game is still challenging as all hell. Or, the outposts and camps will have a weapon which are so far and few between in this game, every time you find one you get hype. That’s called pacing nerds. Bad graphics, ok who gives a **** Gameplay over graphics any day, and besides that the visuals are absolutely gorgeous because of the beautiful art design. As far as FPS drops go, yes this is a valid criticism. I’ve been around several people that have had bad fps issues and crashes. I would rate the game lower than a 10 if I had experienced any of these personally. As far I’m concerned this is one of the best open world games ever made. But also to be fair, this game hasn’t been out long enough for any of us to properly review it, games are like any art, they take time to sit on, ponder and appreciate",10,2022-02-27,PLAYSTATION 5

Jnelrod,Elden Ring is great! As a recent fan of FromSoft titles it was really cool to be part of a community that’s so involved with these games. The reason I gave it a 10/10 is because it took all the best parts of all their other games and put it into an open world environment. Having an idea of what you’re supposed to accomplish in any video game is vital to how you enjoy this game. For me I am at the beginning and I can say that I truly feel like player progression is making my player who starts out without many skills to now having the tools I need to win battles.

The story feels like they replaced the nouns everywhere to re-theme it to 'Grace' and 'Tarnished' instead of 'Bonfire' and 'Ashen One/Chosen Undead' but forgot to make it feel meaningful. I was hoping for what Fromsoft had promised, a departure from the Souls series but this is Dark Souls 3 with a thin coat of paint covering an empty open world. Games like these are hard to develop and are huge financial risks to create, so I respect the work the team did to make this game as good as they could however they have ignored a lot of game design advancements in the industry that would have made a huge difference in making this feel worth my time.

Everything seems polished and stylized it’s fantastic to gander at. There ARE slightly common frame drops in the open world though. Does that actually mean it deserves a 9? Or an 8? Does a couple frame drops really give a game a review bomb of zero? Seems a little steep for such a minor inconvenience. I have fun playing the game! I enjoy it. I love it. And I hope you do too.

In the current state of the game due to stuttering and fps drops and save issues it is a 7/10. I have high hope and I am positive they will fix it. I am on ps5 so I am enjoying the game with very little issues. My problems with the actual game: -Can’t swim(don’t matter that much) -slight smudgy looking objects when too far away What’s good with the game: -Stunning art style and environment -Amazing as usual bosses and characters -improved and adaptive bosses to change according to how you play -Cool gear -Interesting lore and story -great music and sound -Random encounters and being teleported and feeling overwhelmed with greatness when u get thrown in random locations The people complaining about graphics or the way combat is have never touched a from software game in their life. This is how they are. The combat changes on what weapons or magic u have. The combat is good in this game for a from software. Also these games graphics are known to be unique. The art style and environment is what makes them beautiful and they didn’t disappoint here. You can have your complaints but giving it a 0 not even due to the technical issues is just the dumbest **** ever.

Wagion,"Spoiler free Ps5 Performance mode Digital, 73 euro PSN store Prior experience: Completed DS 1, 3, platinumed Bloodborne Abandoned DS2 Elden ring is the latest title from software, known for a series called “Dark souls”. Dark souls is an RPG with super tight level design built to test the player’s skill while providing a fantastic atmosphere and a unique way to tell a story through item descriptions and vague NPC interactions. So successful that it has spawned its own genre named “souls-like”.Elden ring, is an open world spiritual successor, taking place in an open world made by none other than G.R.R Martin, the author of game of thrones. The idea of combining an open world with the unique souls-like genre by the legends themselves sounds too good to be true. The hype leading up to this game has been beyond comprehensible with the metacritic’s critic score currently being a 97 - among the highest scores ever. The world of “the in between” is beautiful. It uses elevated and vertical space to truly capture stunning visuals. The graphics themselves is varying on a scale of “Okay” to “Good”, it lacks small things like plant physics and great looking textures, but it manages to for the most part run at a solid 60 fps, with a few exceptions dropping below but never below 40-50 and never so bad it stutters. Sadly, the world itself isn’t very fun to explore due to feeling “copy pasted”. The ruins all look the same, a handful of ruined buildings, a handful of enemies, and sometimes a tomb leading down to a tomb with a chest or a boss. The chapel often contains a key item, and a checkpoint that doubles as a fast travel point. The enemy camps vary in size and contain a few chests and a few enemies. Castles, caves, and mines are often the more exciting ones, often ending with a boss and some sweet loot to enhance your weapons. They often reward an item called Gold runes, which when used gives you a currency that The game, which heavily focuses on exploration, does not automatically track what you’ve explored and if you’ve missed something, making it extremely confusing if you miss or don't remember where you found something. The open world also comes with a few drawbacks. Mainly, in terms of difficulty. The souls games are known for their difficulty, often being fair and equipping the player by slowly ramping up the already hard difficulty. Elden ring, however, is a lot more open, which can lead players being lost and easily getting too much water over their head, leading to frustration as the game’s only vague hint is to “find the castle” , and your only means of doing so is to follow the vague direction you get when you visit a check point. The “Legacy dungeons” are the only parts of the game that truly has the old fantastic level design of the other games, making them a treat and the overworld feel rather boring to traverse. You always have fun in the dungeons, but you only have fun less than half the time you’re in the overworld, which is most of the game, which makes me miss the old formula. To make traveling less of a hassle, they add a jump button, a mount, fast travel, and a much welcome “checkpoint” before most bosses. The controls are a bit clumsy and takes a while to get the hang of, and sometimes requires you to think twice which can be frustrating when you’re always in danger of dying. The buffer system seems milder than previous entries, but can still occasionally get you killed if you press too many buttons too fast causing you to lose control of your character. The music in souls-like games are often just white noise such as birds, wind, and movement, which fits the atmosphere they’re trying to create. But once a boss appears, the music does a 180 and pumps out some great boss music making bosses truly feel special and magnificent. Combat varies from great to not very enjoyable. You can customise your character just the way you like to play, with a huge arsenal of weapons, magic spells, and new to the series - special weapon abilities, which can be customised with your favourite weapon, creating quite a large number of styles. The game also speeds up the game with faster stamina regeneration (although making stamina less important), and a fast way to counter attack with your shield, making defensive play a lot faster. It introduces Mounted combat, which ends up being jousting, or a game of cat and mouse, which changes and removes the deep satisfying combat into a…”run around the boss and swing until they do a big stomp and repeat”, which feels very underwhelming for a series with such a history with deep and satisfying combat. Overall, I think the game takes 4 steps to the side, but also two steps back. It experiments with the open world, but it feels like it’s missing the “from software polish” because it’s so big and vast instead of small, focused and concise. 6.5/10",7,2022-02-27,PLAYSTATION 5
YourNameHere93,"This game is simply awful and anyone who enjoys it must overlook (or ignore) serious flaws. The game is built on the same Souls game engine since 2008. playing on PS5, or any console or PC, It runs terrible, looks like garbage, has constant pop-in, glitches, and worst of all cannot keep a consistent framerate, let alone being able to hold 60fps. You will experience on average 20 frame drops just by simply moving around, let alone when in combat. As far as “Souls” games go, what makes them difficult isn’t their enemies, it’s the clunky and jank movement of the character, its painfully slow animations and movements, and the fact that it fails to register button controls correctly or precisely. Trying to play this game after playing Horizon Forbidden West, I simply cannot believe anyone would prefer this game in any way, shape or form. Horizon is a modern game with modern graphics, physics, character models, movement, UI, and fluidity. Elden Ring is just another Souls game, released in 2022 and feels like it’s from 2008. Another souls game reskinned, that is uninteresting and built solely on the cliché of “it’s hard bro and you’ll learn to love it” fan base that doesn’t play any modern games or have seen the outside of their mother's basement since the mid-2000’s.",0,2022-02-27,PLAYSTATION 5

B-Cube,"Not usually a Souls fan, but this game man… it’s so good! Its way more accessible and isn’t over the top hard right out the gate. It’s still hard from the get go don’t get me wrong but it feels a little gentler at the beginning than other FromSoftware games. The open world aspects also helps mitigate that classic frustrating loop of dying over and over again to the same thing. If something’s too hard you can go explore and do other things, then come back later once you’re stronger. Only complaint is the performance sometimes. Lots of stuttering. Other than that it’s amazing",9,2022-02-27,PLAYSTATION 5

La propia exploración es lo que hace a su vez que aunque sea dificil el juego no se haga un martirio imposible de llevar. Claramente FromSoftware nunca ha peleado por tener los mejores gráficos, creo que apuestan todo a las dinámicas y a los detalles del lore que nutre cada milimetro del enorme mapa, no hay zona en la que no vivas algo nuevo.",10,2022-02-27,PLAYSTATION 5
thebeik,"Don't usually leave game reviews, but doing my part to combat the 0 scores that are being put up here constantly. First of all this game isn't for everyone - much like most FromSoftware games aren't for everyone. I think all of us nerds alike always are intrigued by these games because of how amazing the worlds they are set are in. Dark High Fantasy and George RR Martin, how could people not want to jump in. Well, unfortunately for most getting a chance to run through these world, explore their secrets and dive into their lore is a dream they'll never fulfill because the right to do that isn't just handed to you - you have to earn it. I think this rings the most true for Elden Ring and is why for the first 4-6 hours I wasn't having a good time with this game. For reference, I have beaten DS3, Bloodborne, and Sekiro prior to this but the start of this game felt wayyyyy harder than any of those. But then after getting my ass handed to me by Margit for the 7th time I decided to go exploring and stumbled upon Weeping Peninsula. After that - it's all she wrote I haven't been able to stop playing this game. The open world aspect of Elden Ring is interesting to say the least - the way it is implemented reminds me a lot of Zelda: Twilight Princess from back in the day. Nothing really is guiding you outside of visual queues and some statues that will point you in the direction of caves and dungeons. This was very frustrating at first because I felt like I was running through a world with nothing to do on the surface level, but once you start to learn what to look for and how the game shows you where to go it really opens up. The combat is really great - sure there are some broken hitboxes here and there and gank bosses still drive me to my greatest rage but man it's so satisfying to try different Ashes of War and break enemy's poise. The sheer variety of locations, secrets, weapons, quests, and replayability of this title will keep me playing for months on end. It really is a nice change of pace compared to modern open world games. If you're struggling don't be afraid to find some guidance online even if it is ""spoiling"" your experience. If you quit at Margit and don't pick it up again there is no experience to spoil. Do what you gotta do. Real rating is 8.5/10 for frame rate issues, massive pop in, and I think a lack of open world mechanic explanation in the beginning. Even though it's a FromSoft game a little more direction to like a trial dungeon or something of that nature would have been helpful for a lot of players. If you can't stand this game then go play Ghost of Tsushima - it's a nice blend between Elden Ring's exploration style, traditional Open World exploration style, and a middle ground of difficulty and combat variety. But seriously, embrace being a Tarnished and struggle and claw to becoming an Elden Lord. It's always worth it.",10,2022-02-27,PLAYSTATION 5

TLangThaKid,"TLDR: Elden ring is FromSoft’s best game this **** is **** Incredible. 10/10 I explain why below. The world of Elden ring is really **** huge with tons to do man, i ain’t even kidding or lying to you the world feels so natural and doesn’t even got that feeling of “oh a game dev put this **** here whatever” and it’s got so many hidden locations in this **** man it’s really a marvel fr. the graphics are really great too overlooking the second region of the game after clearing your first legacy dungeon is staggering, now it ain’t gonna be for everyone, a lot of people like colourful **** and all that, but this game isn’t that, and it’s not suppose to be. like you’re in a DYING and ROTTING world and people are comparing this **** to like horizon and other open world games when this just different this world is suppose to be dull and dying and it does this setting really well. The story is good too, being a From Soft game most of the lore is pretty hidden and not gonna be fed to you through massive amounts of cutscenes, but instead it’s gonna be given through item descriptions and small dialogue with side characters, personally this don’t bother me, it makes getting invested into the world and plot more immersive, i personally don’t like being lore dumped with 5 minutes worth of cutscenes at a time but this is preference i guess, the only lore you get when you start is “yo listen you need to go out and become the Elden lord cuz the world is dying cuz the elden ring broke. ain’t no one out here able to fix it so you do it” it’s simple enough to start but as you go through the game you learn the about the different factions and groups and **** and how the world came to be and how they connected to the bigger world and what happened to certain characters, it all goes so much deeper than led onto be in the beginning it’s some crazy ****. The combat in this game is so refined its the greatest the souls series has seen yet i’m not cappin, this **** is incredible every weapon has unique animations and combos it did away with r1 spam from previous games and really made you think about what moves to do at what time, you have 2 different jumping attacks on every weapon, heavy attacks that have 2-3 hit combos, all weapons have light attack combos with faster weapons having 4-8 hit combos and slower weapons having 3-5. you have weapons arts that can be switch out with ashes of war that can be found in the world there’s so many unique builds you can do with this system man, you can take any weapon “with the exception of legendary weapons” and turn it to scale with different types of damage, there’s so many different options with this systems is actually insane i’m telling you man. The games difficultly has been made in a way that i’m pretty sure anyone can beat it that ain’t to say it’s not hard for veteran souls fans cuz it is, the bosses here will make you their **** man i’m not joking. But nah, i’m talking about using the spirit summoning system. it’s use to take boss aggro is extremely useful to a lot of newer players and the best part is, you don’t even have to use it if you don’t want to, it’s completely optional. during my playthough, i found that the summon is too strong so i straight up ignore it for boss encounters it’s made the game really accessible i think that more people than ever are gonna actually be able to beat this game. Technical wise i have heard somethings that aren’t very good about the game, being perfectly honestly the game doesn’t run that well, especially with what i got setup “i7 9700k, 16 GBs of ram and a asus Strix gtx 970” with this set up i can run the game at 60fps on all low graphic settings, most of the time, i’ve had many frame dips in certain locations and i’ve had the game crash twice over my 30 hours of playing when i Alt Tab on pc so far. FromSoft has addressed these issues and promised an update “in the near future” so hopefully these problems fix soon. as for bugs, i haven’t experienced any in 30 hours, non at all maybe i’m just lucky ion know. no glitches either but i have heard of some torrent glitches like bugging out getting onto him and stuff, but i personally have not had any of those issues. i think i talked bout everything, ion wanna spoil anything cuz this game is honestly at its best going in blind and just discovering **** i’m tellin you guys this **** is gonna be remembered its really one of a kind, it’s does so many different things and it prefects all the things it does. Personally this game is a 10/10, i’m going to assume that within a week or so the performance issues will be fixed so i have no real complains other than that.",10,2022-02-27,PLAYSTATION 5

You can summon a few people for a dungeon or boss fight but that is it. No exploring with friends. The targeting system is sloppy and out of date. While bosses swing their weapons and damage is done to you in any part of their swing while you have to be super accurate with your attack. Not impossible to overcome, but if I just wanted to constantly run in circles with getting a hit in here and there I would play one of the games I already own.

It takes everything that made each Soulbourne games good and combines into one package with a beautiful open well to explore. However, there's just one issue and that's performance which isn't ideal but, does it deserve being review bombed? absolutely not as it will more than likely be ironed out with a few patches.

StixxItt,A game should not be considered good simply because it's challenging. A game is still supposed to be a game and this is barely that. It gives u the most barebones pieces of information on what to do or where to go and tries very little to get u invested in the story or characters at all. It doesn't make u feel connected to your character or the world that you're in as it just throws you into a random location for you to run around and figure it out (which I've come to learn is the usual for souls games). And that's where another prblm comes for me and confuses me about all of these 10/10s. This is pretty much the same as all souls games just a way bigger open world to **** every game has a big open world nowadays so I don't get why this is such a selling point to have different places that u can explore. I can understand getting tired of following a bunch of markers with a crowded HUD and map of icons but most games allow the option to turn this down. It seems like this game is being rewarded for a tremendous lack of effort and its being disguised as groundbreaking. Which brings me to my next point. The lack of options in 2022 is unforgivable. This game assumes that you've played souls games before and judging by the reviews im guessing most reviewers have which I suppose explains the high rating a bit more. If you're a new player like me and countless other normal people it is nearly impossible to go into this game as is without a friend or some sort of guide to help you figure out the most basics of things like where youre even supposed to go. Playing with friends is also a chore as the system that's implemented is a hassle making it almost not even worth it when everytime you or the host dies you immediately return to your world. There's no option to spectate even for a few moments while returning you just immediately go back. Along with having to find/ buy materials to use everytime you want to play with a friend makes it almost not worth using. Why not have a system where you can at least craft a permanent tool to use to transport you to and from a friends world? Along with having stronger ones that allow you to be revived or die more than once or at least be able to spectate your friend after you die? Again seems like they were cutting corners and are being rewarded for it. All in all it kinda **** at this games lack of effort in being an actual game because it does seem to have a great world to explore and be in with cool enemies to fight. However my personal preference for games is to be entertained and have fun not be constantly frustrated for hours for a few moments of joy. I would give it a higher score but the absolute horrendous overhype of this game and the fact that all reviewers are ignoring the glaring problems and turning them into benefits causes me to have give this a zero. I pray this doesn't beat out genuinely good games with compelling stories and characters at the any awards but sadly I know it will and it's honestly a shame. A shame they will be rewarded for a lack of effort. Giving more options to newer players wouldn't hurt core souls fans but would require work on the developer...they obviously didn't want tht.,0,2022-02-27,PLAYSTATION 5

Summoning spirits is fun and it helps newer players. Also, the bosses are still “hard” but fair and enjoyable, horseback fighting is amazing too!

Sycharr,"Sadly, the game is being review bombed by smoothbrains who’ve been coddled too much by Ubisoft titles. They complain of empty worlds when my map is filled with POIs and dungeons, with valuable weapons and armour scattered in nooks rewarding exploration. They complain about performance whilst playing on 7 year old hardware. They complain about no unique ways to travel whilst I find portals connection opposite ends of the map and an elk that can double jump. They complain about copy and pasted environments and enemies yet every major area/biome are extremely diverse and exciting. I’ve around 30 hours played and it’s painfully obvious who’ve played >2 hours, got stuck on a miniboss, didn’t explore anything, and left an emotional 0 before they went to go grab a glass of soy milk. I found an abandoned ruin inside of a mist laden forest. I entered an elevator inside of it. Next thing I know I’m in a massive underground city with immeasurable scale, with geodes on the far ceiling acting as ambient light, reminiscent of the night sky with no light pollution. The sense of wonder and scale in this game is grand, with no areas being similar to the previous in any way. It’s a marvel of gaming as a whole.

MichaelRx3,"El juego es una maravilla en muchísimos aspectos, llevo 20h de juego y me e divertido y tenido ganas de jugar como nunca. Es el primer juego de From que juego, nunca había incursionado en la saga Souls ni Sekiro o Bloodborne, pero eso no me costado en mi aventura. Definitivamente el juego está pensando tanto para público fanático y para los nuevos jugadores. El mundo abierto es fantástico, lleno de enemigo, cuevas, minas, catacumbas y otros zonas que se vuelven muy entretenidas. El juego te pregunto boca una sensación de miedo constante e incertidumbre, ya que no sabes que va a pasar o cuando va a llegar un poderoso jefe de la nada y te matará de dos o un golpe. El combate es bello, las mecánicas en su mayoría son muy amigables y la dificultad es justa y atractiva. Pero no todo es bueno, no le doy el 10 por estás razones puntuales: 1. Los gráficos son viejos, The Witcher 3 maneja gráficos similares y es un juego de 2015 2. El sigilo es pobre, la mecánica es nueva en estos juegos y se nota, ya que la inteligencia artificial de los enemigos que están pensando en hacerlos en sigilo es pobre, puedes pasar a la par sin que te vean mientras estés agachado y si ven un cadáver pasan totalmente de él lo que hace que los campamentos y algunas zonas de catacumbas se vuelvan relativamente sencillas 3. Hay bajones considerables de FPS y si RED DEAD REDEMPTION II pudo tener una experiencia con gráficos altos y con caídas casi nulas de FPS, este juego no puede ser un 10 En resúmen, una de los mejores juegos de la generación, compra asegurada.",9,2022-02-27,PLAYSTATION 5

Elden Ring is a complex game, you will love it or hate it, is a SOULS game in a beautiful well made inmersive opernworld that reward you for HIGH exploration. Now, I understand poeple will not dig the ""git good"" part of the souls community, but in this part, after seeing how bad kids put a 1 or a 0 just cause they are new or dont understand the games mechanics, is just unfair. This game brings all the best from all fromsoftware games, even Sekiro, to build up the best game you can ask for. THERE IS A REASON but Souls games are not for everyone, the game doesn´t hold your hand, doesn´t babysit you, it challenges you, it brings the best of you, not everyone are truly comfortable with this kind of liberty, many need a hand on their shoulders. PC seems to have some problems, but honestly Im runing it without problems on a notebook, so is your desktop hardware problem, dont blame the game that bad.",10,2022-02-27,PLAYSTATION 5

Miseo,"Made this account just to say... Don't listen to the troglodytes review bombing this game. I'm a souls fan so maybe I'm a bit biased but I've been have a fantastic time with the game. It's everything I hoped for. The people saying it has PS3 graphics are... Well, not very bright. At all. The game on PS5 does have some frame drops and textures popping in, but it's not at the level where it actually causes problems while playing. Like at all. Gameplay is what you'd expect from souls, but with new features that make it more fun like countering after a guard, ashes of war, horseback combat, and the open world itself. The open world isn't boring at all. There's no major towns or cities, so if that is what you need in an open world game maybe this isn't for you. It's more like BotW's open world, but more crammed with things to see and do. Graphically the game is beautiful. The style and colours are amazing, especially compared to the bleakness of DS3. Yes the graphics aren't as good as Demons Souls Remake, but that was a remake with the express purpose of maxing the graphics. Not to mention, Elden Ring is a game that is cross-generation. It's not supposed to push next gen to its limits, anyone expecting it should have is just delusional. I've been thoroughly enjoying the game and would easily give it a 10/10. Please don't listen to all the people giving it 1s or 0s because their reviews are entirely in bad faith!!",10,2022-02-27,PLAYSTATION 5

ChipSkylark,"This is a completely unbiased review. I actually like DS. It is a game that is fully committed to being itself and doesn't pretend to be anything it's not. This game, through ALL fault of it's own, marketed itself to people who love open world RPG's but just couldn't fall in love with DS because of it's difficulty, repetitiveness and questionable mechanics. They knew that if they threw out George RR Martin's name, promoted ""open world"" and talked about how this game is a departure from the Souls series for a variety of different reasons, that they would gain a MASSIVE amount of new players. Do you think FromSoftware isn't aware that the majority of people purchase games digitally (AKA not able to be returned) these days? It was a total win win for them. The worst thing that happens is they sell a ridiculous amount of copies, recruit players who were on the fence about Souls games (doesn't matter if they don't like it after the fact), and retain their loyal player base who love DS so that there are enough good reviews to keep up a positive image.

Then for the gameplay, as a mage you'll experience some ""fun"" at the beginning but this fun will rapidly decreased since you're going to be more and more useless by the time spent on the game (lack of damage...). It clearly impact too much of the gameplay for me. There is even an invisible ""boss"" that you can barely kill just because you're a mage. And if you forget the gameplay as a mage, this game is good but that just don't deserve a 10/10 review like a lot of people did, too much hype just for that...

DragonMan85,"I want to like this game so much... The elements are all there, but there is just a polish missing from the games aesthetics, and a blandness stemming from the studios inexperience with open world games. There are land marks everywhere smattered with enemies, but there is no real point to them. Exploration is often rewarded by blank grass cliff edges and maybe a few berries to pick. The graphics look old due to poor textures, and the unlocked framerates lead to microstutters. Updates can save this game to a 7/10 but it just lacks the beauty of its predecessor Demons Souls Remake. It still gets a five, because that classic DS formula that is so addictive that it keeps you playing... even if you don't really want to.

The difficulty is sometimes absurd, and the level-design still... Well, I would say really weird (to not say bad).

HanSolo123,"Im a big fromsoft fan, played and finished all games. My favorite best is Sekiro, **** loved that game. But this one feels like DS2 with better bosses / environment. The mechanics are very similar, except for the jump feature. The character is slow, and it feels like the mechanics of your character are from 2010: just slow and goofy, while the enemies / bosses have more advanced mechanics, its like your character runs at half the speed, and the bosses are 1.5X speed. just weird. The result is a slow awkward combat system especially when trying to beat a boss. This game feels like 1000 steps back from DS3, and it is not a standalone franchise, feels and plays like DS2 remake. And the frame rate on pc always drops.. **** man, really wanted to love this game.",3,2022-02-27,PLAYSTATION 5

S1LVERSurfer93,"I am new to FromSoftware titles. From the outside looking in I always thought they looked slow, boring, and too difficult. Once I jumped into Bloodborne, the premise and gameplay loop clicked and I understood why people loved them so much. Elden Ring takes this challenging, yet rewarding, gameplay loop and puts it into a beautiful and massive open world with endless things to go and explore and witness. There are countless epic moments you’ll come across that’ll leave your jaw on the floor. For fans of this genre this game is something really magical that’ll bring enjoyment for years to come. I understand that this game appeals to a niche audience and it’s sad to see that it’s getting review bombed by people outside the genre or people upset with the high scores who just don’t get it. In a similar way, I’m bored to death playing Mario games or Racing Sims, yet I understand those games are not for me so I’m not out there critically reviewing a game I’m not the audience for. I hate call of duty games but I don’t go review bomb them. People really need to grow up and learn to say “this game isn’t for me.” And leave it at that instead of giving it a ridiculous 0/10. Y’all out here making yourselves look silly.",10,2022-02-27,PLAYSTATION 5

TrueGamer1,"By far the best out of the series. Never had a game make me drop my jaw as much as elden ring (and trust, I've played ALOT of games). The art and world design is next level, while it may look simple at first, after the castle everything changes. The bosses are next level to, there are multiple that in any other game, you'd expect it to be the final boss. Granted it's not, you are only getting started. Lol, The designs, moves and abilities just leave you there in awe.. Would without question recommend this game to anyone! Granted I will say, this game doesnt hold your hand. It doesn't tell you where to go besides a vague yellow light (grace) or if you skipped something. It really makes you feel like you are truly in control of your own story. You get to choose your own path right at the get go. Also combat is MASSIVELY improved from the past games. There are SO many different melee abilities or spells that really change up the game! Personally, I'll never forget my experiences playing this game, it makes me feel like a kid again, actually staying up all night to get past a certain point. Games like these only come once in a generation. If I was you, I wouldn't miss out on this masterpiece! 10/10. Also if you are worried about framerate, dont be. It's very rare and only in certain areas. Even then it's not bad at all and knowing fromsoftware, I'm sure it'll get fixed soon.",10,2022-02-27,PLAYSTATION 5

I would recommend Darksouls remastered first, but Elden Ring is a good starting point as well. So much choice and options, you can tailor the game to your liking. I do want Fromsoft to make another Bloodborne or Darksouls game (more linear) to scratch that itch for a tight, dark, intertwined experience. Elden Ring takes the best aspects from all of their previous work and combines them to make an outstanding game, however it isn’t a better Darksouls game than Darksouls. It isn’t a better Bloodborne game than Bloodborne (if that makes sense). Overall, this game rocks and I hope everyone gets a chance to experience it.",10,2022-02-27,PLAYSTATION 5

xamrah,"You can pretty much ignore all the poor scores if they mention technical issues, because not only are they already halfway fixed after a day, they really weren't that bad to begin with. The game itself might be as close to a perfect game as mankind can get. You are given a horse to explore this souls like world, but you will barely have time to ride it because there is just so much stuff to explore. I have found myself saying ""ok I will just ride to that town I've been heading to all day."" But about thirty seconds into my ride I see a tomb door enticing me inward. The result is I spend the next hour fighting through some underground level to fight a boss and take am ash of war or a special item or a weapon. And this exact thing happens a lot, each time the enemies are totally different, the boss is totally unique and the loot feels well earned. Not only is the game addicting but it looks amazing. Sometimes I actually have to stop and just look at the scenery. The textures are a bit dated, as they are with all Fromsoftware games, but the ambiance and lighting totally steel the show and you entirely forget about dates textures. The questing system is by far the best I have ever seen in an open world game or From game. Sometimes you will be exploring and find a random NPC who will just have a few dialogue options and it seems like nothing important. But in reality, that NPC as a hidden side quest that is triggered by giving them an item and ultimately unlocks a major function of upgrading. Or else grants you a very powerful weapon. People who say the game is boring either haven't played a souls game and thus don't understand how to find secrets in these games, or are too quick to judge and didn't actually spend time doing anything besides slapping dudes as a hero. That's the next big thing in this game, the character creation is even more open than ever. If you played DS3 and wished for better magic and faith options you're in luck, they have been massively enhanced this time around and playing a mixed build for say faith and strength is a bit more interesting now. Don't trust 0/10, this game is probably the best game of the souls genre and a very very good game in general.",10,2022-02-27,PLAYSTATION 5
Davit595,"Many people are rating low due to technical issues, I also have crashes and fps drops, but that can be fixed with patches. What cant be fixed in later patches is bad design, bad game mechanics, lame story and world. And From Software doesnt need it as they gave us all those on the highetst level.

Pp4life,"I want to start off by addressing many of the 0-4 star reviews. I question these peoples credibility because many of them are rating the game low because of the graphics. I’ve read many reviews where it starts off with “the graphics are…!” Now, I don’t know about you, but how credible is a reviewers opinion on a game when their sole focus is the graphics? One review literally said they gave the game a lower score simply to balance out the hype. I would argue that their credibility is of the lowest quality. While graphics are not “mind blowing,” the game more than makes up for it with the structure of the open world and gameplay. The open world feels organic; there are no markers that highlight important areas. If you want to find weapons, secret dungeons, bosses, etc., you have to explore and find those things yourself. The game does not hold your hand and tell you what to do. The environments are structured in a such a way that it draws your attention, but, at the end of the day, you must be the one to go out and explore the world to find it’s treasures. I’ve ran into so many caves and dungeons form just simply trying to get from point A to point B and being side tracked by something looking interesting in the distance. The combat, while very similar to Dark Souls, feels responsive and fluid. Enemies are not necessarily difficult, but rather intelligent; they try to bait you to attack early so that you make a mistake. The game demands that you consciously react to enemies and not simply panic dodge or attack for the sake of button mashing. Once you understand that, the combat clicks and even the pace of combat speeds up, as you dodge between enemy attacks, counter with your own attack, parry, jump attack, and create spacing/ close distances. There are a wide range of basic enemies and an even more diverse set of bosses which will truly test your ability to think in combat. The story is true to Fromsoftware; it is vague and obscured. It is up to the player to piece the events of the world together. If you are all about the story in a game, then I can understand some frustration here, but if you are a fan of other From titles, then you know exactly what you are getting. Overall, the game is fantastic. They have crafted an open world that is fun to explore while not being a chore to do so. From has tuned their combat system to a T. It might not be for everyone, especially those that simply want to button mash and not think about their actions during combat; or those that become angered and enraged by dying to enemies. But for long time fans of the other titles, this is a must play.",10,2022-02-27,PLAYSTATION 5

JMillzo89,"I mean what could go wrong right. The formula FromSoft has made is a iron clad one. This game is mesmerizing, fun and also overwhelming all at the same time. You feel the DNA of all FromSoft games mostly Dark Souls and a little hint of Bloodborne and Sekiro. It's an amazing experience, that I haven't even beat yet. The point deduction is mainly because pop in and framerate issues are noticeable and can sometimes take you out of the game. I know its early but this is sometimes bad enough to where you think the game is faulty. But nonetheless Miyazaki and team deliver on this MASSIVE experience that is worth applauding. Just be aware that software issues may bug you a bit. Pun not intended.",9,2022-02-27,PLAYSTATION 5

OGBobbyjohnson,"Haters need to check themselves. The only flaw in this game is indeed the frame rate, but it's really not bad at all apart from the very beginning of the game. The game is very enjoyable and doesn't have bugs that affect the game as people are saying, frame rate drops are not bugs. People who have never played these games claim the graphics are bad, but graphic fidelity is far less important than the overall artstyle and look of the game, which is incredibly beautiful. The gameplay is a refinement of the souls gameplay, so if you enjoy that you'll the gameplay. The open world is a revolution as it doesn't hold your hand, and there's a wealth of things to discover, on your own, without ubisoft style map markers. Most complaining have probably never played/liked fromsoft games, and that's okay. But claiming it's a buggy mess with bad graphics is disingenuous .",10,2022-02-27,PLAYSTATION 5

Gitgudgitgud,"If bosses have literally endless amount of combos and special attacks, one after another and then you can maybe get one hit and most of the fight you are just in defense mode, rolling around endlessly, trying to escape, not fight. This is pathetic. This is not good combat design. This is awful. Unless you love to just endlessly run away and feel how pathetic you are, maybe you gonna love this combat, but i like games where you can actually truly fight back or have cool battles. Rolling around and hoping to get one hit between 30 seconds is not fun or good design. Jesus christ this game is overrated.",0,2022-02-27,PLAYSTATION 5

Fonta99,"Amazing game. If you liked any past From Software game you'll love Elden Ring. The game is great. Gameplay is definitely great, similar to DS3 but with new stuff. The open world is really nice, I don't know how people are saying it's empty, IT'S LITTERALY FULL OF STUFF, every new place has something new. The game is enormous, it seems it won't end. I played for 20 hours and I'm still probably at 10% of the total game. It has issues of course, framerate drops, stuttering, pop in, and stuff at a distance is really bad to look at. But the game is great, from software always had some problems at optimizing their game but in the end it's the fun you have and they make great games. It's not definitely a 10 but because people are giving it a 0 which is crazy, i'm givint it a 10, normal vote would be 9. Play the game before saying it's empty. It's almost impossible people already finished the game especially with seing every place and without rushing.",10,2022-02-27,PLAYSTATION 5

I see a lot of people complaining about this game mostly about the technical issues. Thankfully, that can be easily changed. However, the people complaining about the rest of the stuff just don't know what they are talking about.

Joy_Divide,"This game is a masterpiece. I picked up the game Friday, started playing about 7pm. It’s now 11.30am on Sunday, and have 22 hours played. The world design is a massive step forward for open world games. You are given no direction, and yet quite quickly, become engrossed in exploration, Elden Ring doesn’t want to let you go. There’re enemies and items in every direction. Caves, camps, villages, ruins, castles and keeps, what they’ve achieved here is something great. The crafting is simple and does not distract you from the core mechanics of the game. The world is huge, In my 22 hours, I’ve only had two boss models be repeated / reused, and even in those cases, the boss had either a different weapon or something added to the fight to mix things up. The combat is fluid and, while it has it’s quirks, it’s essentially what we’ve come to expect in a From game. The bosses are varied in both aesthetic and challenge. While most will not deliver that frustration and block to progression your first stab at Smough and Ornstein did 10 years ago, they test your skill and knowledge of the game non the less. People seem obsessed with the performance and graphics of the game. Well, no From game is known for it’s stellar performance on release . Either they’re not familiar with From games, or they are, and they’re just sensitive to fps dips. The game does drop below 60 dps in performance mode on PS5, but never to an extent that results in the game crashing or becoming unplayable. I’ve had graphical pop ins, bugs where my mount didn’t spawn in and I was left flying in mid air, rendering issues, and fps drops. But none of that has affected my enjoyment of Elden Ring because… this game is everything we could have asked for and From have knocked it out of the park. On the graphical issues and performance, people need some perspective. No PS5 game runs well in any sort of the quality, resolution, cinematic mode, the fps is always unbearable… we’re two years in and this is still the case. Nobody talks about this. All PS5 games are essentially last gen (PS4) ports with checkboarding resolution / upscaling. In general, almost every game released nowadays is unfinished, and the price tag for exclusives and annual releases has gone up to £60 or £70. You can’t have everything I’m afraid, we have backward compatibility, well, we sacrificed a true generational leap in the progress. Elden Ring does what it can with the limitations placed on it for having to be developed for 5 different platforms, I can almost guarantee that the game would be better optimised and look better overall, if it were only developed for PS5, Series X and PC. One last note. Graphically the game is somewhat identical to Dark Souls 3. But to come out with what they’ve produced in the 4 or 5 years since Senior, is nothing short of astounding. Yes, it is disappointing that we’re not looking at Demon’s Souls aesthetics, but please remember that Demon’s Souls was PS5 only, all development time went into optimising the game for that platform. Elden Ring has been developed with last PS4 players in mind.",10,2022-02-27,PLAYSTATION 5

SickAcid,"This game is the ultimate experience from fromsoft. They have added and tweaked all the best parts of each of their soulsborne + sekiro games. I don't get why everyone is rushing to bash this game. Yes it has its performance problems, but I have tested on multiple platforms and it is not as bad as some people make it. They will surely improve the game performance. We saw the exact thing with bloodborne. I think this game is a masterpiece and it has some extremely dense content and things to explore. For such a scale, I think that the price tag is a blessing. Never seen triple A games done with such passion. For me at least, it is the best game of all time.",10,2022-02-27,PLAYSTATION 5

Yooper,"This game is phenomenal! I have loved this game so much since getting it and it is likely my favoutite game ever. I have put around 100 hours into it, 3 playthroughs in total and every one of them has been an amazing experience. I get that some people really care about the techinical side of games, like the graphics and the frame rate, but at the end of the day the frame rate drops are very infrequent on PS5 and don't cause much issue, and the graphics aren't bad. Sure they aren't as good as horizon forbidden west or demon's souls but that isn't fromsoftware's focus so people shouldn't be expecting graphics like that. What makes the game look beautiful is the artstyle instead, this is where the developers main focus is and I wish people would understand that before buying the game and then giving it a low rating. If you care a lot about the techincal part of games, don't get this game. It's not trying to have the best graphics ever so don't expect it to. However, if you enjoy ""souls-like"" games or like open world games that have difficult and engaging combat, I would definately recommend this game.",10,2022-02-27,PLAYSTATION 5

I barely played an hour of Sekiro and a few unsuccessful hours of DS3 but I immediately feel so much more comfortable and motivated to explore and progress in Elden Ring. I’m not too worried about performance issues, because I’m sure it’ll be patched up soon (and then become a 10/10 for me). Aside from the fantastic enemies and graphics and open ended nature of combat, the traversal feels so good with the mount, Torrent. I also appreciate the little things - being able to jump, still parry, more magic, more color (far less dreary and bland, but still very dreadful and sinister at times). I also enjoy knowing that taking out a horde may refill flasks, or that I can spawn close to an important area even without the “bonfires” I’m sure players are so used to relying on. There isn’t as much back tracking or pointless treks back to a boss because you can go anywhere so easily. I’m very happy with the game so far.",9,2022-02-27,PLAYSTATION 5

Tommycbs,For me this is a strange one to review. I initially hated it but kept going and going until I got better. The beginning is the hardest part. By the end the boss’s were dropping first time and there is many OP builds you can make at any time. The fact there is co op for the boss’s too really doesn’t make this much of a challenge if you have someone that’s good. As a game it is addicting as hell and I’ve got to give it credit for that. It’s got a few small performance issues but nothing too bad. The story is non existent but the gameplay is so fun at times you don’t really care. It is Over hyped by critics and I think games like TLOU and horizon are way way better. But this was still pretty damn good.,9,2022-02-27,PLAYSTATION 5

You can point a random spot on the map and find everything: npc, new enemies, boss, quests. And all of this is always new. I really can’t understand why some people are saying that the open world is empty when clearly is not, maybe they are fan of Ubisoft or CD project where every mission is the same, 2 to 3 type of mission repeated over and over again. Character are really good and the gameplay is fun to. Is a lot similar to dark soul but trust me, if you don’t use the new mechanics you will be punished a lot, the game is balance around the new stuff.

I had a few hours of fun with Dark Souls 3, so I wanted to give the game a chance. So I got infected by the countless good reviews and bought the game yesterday for 60 euros. But then what do I have to experience on my PS5. Underground graphics - PS3 niveau - (even Dark Souls 3 was better by lengths!!!) many jerks and frame pacing problems. The fight is an absolute horror with it. The controls are so imprecise, and the HitBoxes are a disgrace to this series. No PS5 controller specific features implemented! I hope I can find someone to buy this game from me who has more fun with it. I am out, FromSoftware. In the future, only at budget price, or when there are demo versions (see Cyberpunk 2077, Project Red finally got it after 1.5 years). The gaming industry is so broken!

FredrikM,"I belive a lot of casual gamers coming to Elden Ring expecting it to be a new assasins creed/gamings equivalent to instant gratification fast food. Thats fine, From Softs game are not meant to appeal to everyone. If you dont like gamings version of fine dining, stick to Ubisoft and good riddance. Make no mistake, this is a fantastic game. I find that people are complaining and scoring 0 out of 2 reasons: Either they nag about the framerate (A common player will rarely or ever notice the dips, and will for sure be fixed in an upcoming patch) or they simply dont understand they game. Both times off they are to quick to judge. Take your time with Elden Ring and you might be having one of the most rewarding gaming experinces yet.",10,2022-02-27,PLAYSTATION 5

phulp,"I've been a die-hard fan of this 'series' since demon souls. I think Bloodborne is one of the best, if not the best, game ever made. I had been looking forward to this 'new IP' and the professional reviews were out of this world - 'best game ever' says the Guardian... etc etc. I have to say I'm a little disappointed. It is Dark Souls 4 in all but name. The 'open world' hype seems unwarranted. Yes the world is large but fundamentally it is no more open than worlds in the other souls games. The performance issues widely reported - well, I can confirm those. It seems crazy that this game would slow down on a PS5 when games like Returnal, Ghost of Tsushima, and even the Demon Souls remake(!) run flawlessly with superior graphics. Why would they not invest in making this game as slick as possible? The style of the world and the combat is identical to previous souls games. I mean identical. They've added the ability to jump and crouch, but those are exactly as you would expect them to be. The amount of innovation here is overstated. Overall I'm still going to play it, but I'm not gripped by it as I have been by previous souls games. I definitely felt a bit let down by just how identical it is to Dark Souls. Bloodborne and Sekiro were phenomenal games that broke the mould and moved away from the tried and tested souls mechanics - but Elden Ring simply picks up where DS3 left off.

Finest hypocrisy i have ever seen. I agree, Far Cry 6 is extremely outdated, but so is Elden Ring. Same animations, worse controls than any Ubisoft game. If Fromsoft doesn't innovate and gets 97 on Metacritic, why do you think Ubisoft would even care to innovate at this point? Even if they try, these Hypocrites still sht on them and praise this unfinished trash (Elden Ring) as next generation of open world games.

I‘m trying as hard as I can to like the game but there are just too many cons/ not enough pros yet. - performance is really bad on PS 5 even in performance mode (40-50 fps) + multiple crashes. That is not acceptable on PS 5 in 2022. Actually unplayable for me - missing Story/ Character development (George RR Martin? Where?!) -graphics in general are outdated (not the artstyle, i love it) - Open World feels empty (maybe because the lack of some story?) Compared to other high quality openworld games I feel like there isn‘t much to explore. The few dungeons are very short, boring and repetitive. At least most other areas are restricted simply by being to hard -> not my definition of an open world (For reference I‘ve beaten M***it at Lvl. 16 with no help) All these points resulting in cluelessness what to do next.

(Obviously the game has flaws, but these absolute man children giving the game a zero out of ten for frame drops are just laughable.) 10/10 Best game ever, without question. Wonderful art style brought up by very nice particle and lighting effects. Many games bring more advanced graphic systems, but many games fail to have even close to the amount of presence and gravitas that Elden Ring has. It is the result of over a decade in experience, taking what works from every game From has put out. It is a love letter to fans of their previous games. The difficulty curve can be mitigated by exploring and basically questing in the open world, though victory is always achieved by your timing and confidence.

I’ve clocked 20+ hours and think it’s been an exciting expansion from prior iterations in the Soulsbourne series. That said, Soulsbourne games aren’t for everyone. Most of the people who review this highly tend to love this genre already. I am one of those people. These are my favorite games, without a doubt. When I see reviews panning the game for graphics and minor frame rate stutter, I can’t help but think that these reviewers were kind of bound to not like these games. These games are not about graphics. They aren’t about a tight, neat story. This is a game focused on an exceptionally refined combat system vs. some of the most thoughtfully designed hurdles to overcome with that combat system. The result is, to me, the most rewarding games I’ve ever played. If that sounds like your cup of tea, you’ll love this game.",10,2022-02-27,PLAYSTATION 5

Lithium796,"2011 saw the release of two of the most influential games for the RPG genre, dark souls and Skyrim. One was a complex and mysterious game, with some of the greatest level designs in modern gaming - and the other was an adventure through a seemingly limitless fantasy world. Both were fantastic games in their own right, but even back then I always dreamed of a Skyrim with the addictive combat and difficulty of dark souls, and likewise I dreamed of a dark souls that had the sandbox freedom of Skyrim. Fast forward to 2022 and this dream has been realised. The open world element of Elden Ring reinvigorates the souls-like core gameplay symbiotically. The great level design and inter connectivity of dark souls is still here, and so is the great combat and progression. But now we have a huge open world full of secrets to uncover. In dark souls sometimes the difficulty could be suffocating, with your only option to “get gud” and grind your way through a **** place like Sen’s Fortress. In Elden Ring when things get hard you can teleport across the map and set off in a direction of your choosing. Levelling up while uncovering lore rich dungeons and points of interest. It honestly never even feels like grinding. This game still isn’t for everyone, if you’re looking for a game that is completely accessible and has the best graphics of the decade - this might not be it. But if you’re even slightly willing to give the souls-like combat a decent try, and if you love fantasy RPGs - this is absolutely the best game of its kind since 2011.",10,2022-02-26,PLAYSTATION 5

yepus,"This game is truly a masterpiece I've heard people complaining about performance and I know it doesn't run good on the pc port, but I'm running it on a ps4 on a **** tv and it runs perfectly. (that also might be because I have never seen over 45fps in my life). also who gives a **** if the graphics aren't next gen. They are a major step up from ds3 and sekiro, and when I play a video game story, world, gameplay , and art direction take a massive priority over graphics, and this game delivers on all of those fronts people are actually complaining about difficulty? It's a ****ing soulsborne git gud. one thing I was worried about initially was the open world. as we all know open world games tend to have boring in between areas. I am 10 hours in and yet to beat Margit and never once have I been bored of running around on the horse exploring the world. overall if I could give this game an 11 I would",10,2022-02-26,PLAYSTATION 5
RUSTYNAIL77,"I would have given a 10 if the controls were easier.. I play the game on PC and I haven't had any frame rate issues. I have a Geforce RTX 2060, 32GB of DDR4, SSD Drive and Intel i7-10700F processor. I am an experience gamer, I have been playing games since 1990 roughly. This game is a huge challenge and it has a learning curve, if you are into either of those jump right in. If you are looking for something you can easily hack and slash your way through, look elsewhere. Most people whining about the game are probably doing so because they couldn't take the time to figure it out. The game does minimal hand holding and I mean minimal. With enough gameplay time under your belt you will start to figure out the nuances of the game. I find the graphics very nice on PC and I have no frame rate problems. My only complaint is the huge learning curve on mouse/keyboard controls. it seems the devs wanted a minimal hud, because you can take it away with a push of a key. No hotbars, no nothing, just key bindings. Thankfully I have a mouse and keyboard where I can assign keystrokes to mouse keys and it makes it easier but hotbars would help. They should give the player the option on whether or not to use them. I am really enjoying the game so far though. Understand that when you initially start playing you will die fast and start thinking the game ****. You have to keep going after that to see the beauty in this game. If you have a nice PC, this is a must have. I can't speak for the quality of the game on consoles.",9,2022-02-26,PLAYSTATION 5

ValerianVoid,"The ultimate Dark Souls open world expierence, it's definitely captured my heart since I've been a fan of these games since 2013, performance isn't as bad as most of the review bombers are saying unless they're on older consoles, on PS5 I've had a constant 60 FPS and after a recent patch one day after release I've had no stuttering either. Elden Ring will definitely be a game that's talked about years and years from now, it's absurdly beautiful with a lot to do in the open world, it's still a great challenge but with minor safety nets such as checkpoint like items right before a big boss fight or tough area that let's you respawn closer to the area if you die, accessibility without lowering difficulty overall.

Jorge8,"From software has been making the same game for the past 10 years. Elden ring is just the new installment on a series of overrated copy and pasted collection of files that their fans have the nerve to “call best game ever made”. Clunky and choppy animations, old art assets, repurpose hero and enemy moves. unpolished lighting. Same old enemy archetypes on new skins. Zero to none AAA cinematic sequences, unacceptable facial animation. Rubbish storytelling. Outdated AI, bad audio filtering and occlusion. Shading and material errors. performance issues across all platforms; These are issues that haven’t evolved at all on their past souls games. In essences, the souls series are a one of a kind type of experience that I have enjoyed in the pass. But its 2022 and with games as polish as Red Dead redemption, Last of Us 2, god of war, death stranding and more coming. Its just pretty unfortunate to see gaming news outlets jumping on this 10s crazy thing as if the game is a perfect masterpiece. Fear of backlash maybe? Who knows. Hope this “toxic” quick overview of this new old boring game open some eyes out there. As gamers we should demand better. Don’t change the core of the franchise. But please From Software step up your game in all department. Renew that engine. Get some good animators. Write a coherent story. Make those hero combat animations feel more real. Realistic blood splatters. Dynamic enemy decapitations. Proper cloth and physics simulation. The list of things to bring to your game is honestly a mile long. Or well, like your fans would say.

Aszach,"Elden Ring proves to be the best game From Software's ever created. - The world is massive with a lot of things going around (Mobs, Secrets, Bosses etc.) - Gameplay imho is the best one out of all the souls borne games, shields are useful in this game and not mention counter-guard is the OP attack second only to Jumping Attack which will help you beat a hard boss) - Accessibility during boss fight is the most accessible out of all souls borne games, Marika statue existence completely remove the players on hassling all the way through the boss arena. - The world is just simply amazing and a lot secrets might I add that will make you lose tons of hours of sleep just wanting to discover new places. - Bosses while some speaking of mechanics are very similar to previous souls borne games but majority are rather fresh and are enjoyable not to mention even with the existence of Marika Statue that doesn't mean you won't be using that a lot as some bosses are still rather difficult. I have been playing the game since it release and have accumulated atleast 20 hours and i have progressed a lot but the world is so huge that it felt like i was just barely scratching it's surface.

To call it the greatest of all time you need more than just a good game play, it's missing the graphics, story, music and optimization. Story wise it didn't have any deeply crafted story like the Witcher or dramatic story that bind you and the character like Read Dead Redemption 2 did with Arthur.

agent13,"I played this game and i could stand it only for 3 hours, just another extremely over hyped and overrated game by from software first of all the gameplay is a huge step backward from sekiro (even though i didn't like that game either) the combat is slow, clunky and tedious and most importantly unacceptably difficult without any option to customize the difficulty that's an industry standard that from software intentionally doesn't follow. other than difficulty which is no problem for those who have hours of time to die and retry (I don't, i'm a busy person aren't most of us?) the whole gameplay and the world of the game feels very old like early 7th generation games old. the world and the map is pretty much empty and it's funny that the critics are praising elden ring for being open world as if they have never seen an open world game in their life! while the game has a relatively good artistic design and as all from software games the bosses and enemies have amazing design but the technical graphics of the game is like ps3 games and not acceptable for a 9th generation game. as always the story of the game is just there... not interesting at all it doesn't motivate you to keep playing you are left in a huge map full of empty.. overall it's a big shame and saddening that this game has a meta score close to masterpieces like RDR 2, GTA 4 & 5, god of war, etc how the hell didn't even one critic didn't give this game a score lower than 90 I tried too hard but it's impossible to enjoy this game.",2,2022-02-26,PLAYSTATION 5

I have been playing and discovering that huge map without any feeling of boringness. I feel that I finally became curious again when playing a game. Riding through every corner, to find treasures and beautiful dungeons. Not to speak the sense of community already known by Dark Souls players. There are many classes, and many ways to play the game. You get crafting. You get weapons upgrades. And you also get challenge. Just like in Sekiro where you know you are not ready for a boss, but you want to keep trying to get good.

BoomLBS,In no way is this a 10/10 - I’ve been made a fool again. If you like boss fights and getting killed over and over and over again until you learn the rhythm then go for it. The open world is cool at first but you quickly realise that it is completely absent of story and reason for being. You are only exploring so you can find a some stupid rubbish to add to your flask or slowly improve your stats. The game starts with a loose story structure and some guidance of where to go but within one hour you meet a boss that is really difficult. You then have no idea of what to do and just start walking around. I managed to defeat two side bosses and level up my character quite a bit. But in my 10 hours of wandering i never came across an interesting side story. Just lots of things to fight. - which quickly becomes really tedious. I’m giving it a 6 as I get why some people would love it. But 10’s are surly reserved for games with broader appeal and for open worlds that actually have interesting things to interact with.,6,2022-02-26,PLAYSTATION 5

Huitzilopochtli,"The game is Dark Souls 3 with a horse. The PS5 version is broken; the best way to play is on a digital PS4 version on PS5 with backwards compatibility. The PS5 version, even on Performance mode, cannot hit 60 fps or stably run the game without massive frame drops. I guess Fromsoftware extended their cryptic methods usually used for storytelling to how to purchase and play the game. -No new ideas. Exchange runes for souls, the maiden for firelink shrine maiden, tarnished for hollowed, etc. It's the lore of Dark Souls with new names. George RR Martin had little to no impact on the story. -Ugly graphics, especially compared to Demon's Souls Remake. Elden Ring looks like a PS2 game by comparison -Copy-paste combat from Dark Souls 3; just dodge, hit, and dodge. -Boring setting. How many games in general and in the Soulsborne series are going to be set in Medieval Western Europe? Choose a new setting like Sekiro or Bloodborne. -Open-world. Meaning you run across empty fields for 10 minutes to get to an actual fun part of the game. -Copy-paste enemies. The Black Knights from Dark Souls 1 are back, as well as the Crabs from 3. I haven't seen an original enemy yet. Every version of this game (PS5, PC, etc) is technically broken with invisible enemies, freezes, FPS drops, stuttering where you teleport from one area to another, crashes to white screen, and more. Even without these grips, there is nothing new or exciting here. The AAA gaming industry has released one buggy, unfinished copy-paste game after another. In the future this game, alongside Cyberpunk 2077, will be seen as epitome of our increasingly dumbed down and decadent era.",0,2022-02-26,PLAYSTATION 5

Elitenoob85,"Absolutely the best game I have ever played in my life, hands down. Expect a challenge if your new to the Soulsbourne games, the difficulty is way over exaggerated, and the game gives you the tools to make it easier if you need, and there is so much freedom that you can always just move to a different area to if your stuck, and can come back after you’ve leveled up. Early game is always hard for new players, until you level up, get the gear you like and find your flow. But once you learn the flow the game is not “insanely hard” at all. It’s a deep game, but that’s why it’s so rewarding. Don’t expect much hand holding, this game won’t lead you around on a leash like others. But that’s the beauty, and what makes you feel like your on actual adventure. Instead of just watching cutscene after cutscene, being told where to go and what to do and how to do it. You will have to actually think some. There is no quest log. You will die, but you will overcome. You will find your way. And if you need help, there is a whole giant community ready to tell you to “Git gud” no really tho as long as your not whiny, people will help and guide you with WHATEVR you need. Just don’t show up crying or complaining that this games is trash. Show your resolve and determination, you will get respect and all the help you need. Not about being good, it’s about not being a baby. It’s about understanding these games are about the adventure, not the “difficulty”. This game sets out and perfectly nails what it’s trying to do. It’s not about just being hard, it never has. It’s about exploration, the journey, the atmosphere, the adventure. The hardship and overcoming it to become beast mode. Then you start wrecking dudes, until you get comfortable and come up against an enemy who only SEEMS insanely hard at first, and get destroyed. But you rise and come back to overcome. The performance has been ifffy for some. I’m on Ps5 and get an occasional small frame drop but for me that’s it, and even still I can’t imagine playing anything else right now, performance be damned. It’s worse for others granted, but that will get fixed. I never thought these games would be for me, I didn’t like “hard just be hard” games, until I actually finally played through one, and it clicked, and now after playing all of fromsoftware games from DeS, I understand the diehards. This is easily their magnum opus, a love letter to Fromsoft fans, but also anyone wanting to experience the FS formula for the first time. Don’t believe the negative posts that don’t relate to performance. Some games just aren’t for some people, doesn’t make them bad games. Being mad at performance is understandable, game breaking to some, but rest assure that once it is, you will understand why everyone who’s been able to play it before release has been giving it a 10/10. THANK YOU FROMSOFT!!!! You have done your fans proud, and we hope for a fix to the Performance issues so that no one will have any excuse to not play this game. Time will tell and I’m not worried about it success in the long run. So peace out, Im not a writer and have been ranting long enough, I’m heading back to The Lands Between on my magistical horned stead to stand beneath the Erdtree and make my claim. And I truly hope those who are having a difficult time with performance a speedy recovery so you can join in jolly cooperation!",10,2022-02-26,PLAYSTATION 5

There was an underground city with a star system at one point. The only negative reviews that i can understand and somewhat stand with would be the ones with the performance issues on pc, (didn't have issues with my ps5 so far). and i'm sorry for people who encountered save breaking bugs and stuff. it is very unlucky, and it is a thing that i'm sure fromsoft didn't want in their game... but in all honesty, save game issues have been in games ever since save data feature was introduced. (i had to replay rdr2 3 times cause my save data got corrupted on multiple occassions) This game looks so pretty and calling it a ps3 is very stupid and demented. also get your head out of the gutter, wanting a climbing system. just cause you don't know how to scale the environment, doesn't mean that everyone is brain dead as you and just wants to play uncharted/tombraider it is a masterpiece overall, if you don't get the performance issues that some are having. it is a 9.5/10 for me, but since irrational reviews are a normality on metacritic now and everyone saying 0 when it is 6 in their opinion. it is a 10/10",10,2022-02-26,PLAYSTATION 5

Bad reviews are all saying the same thing : performance issues (oh noooo the game dropped to 50 fps for half a second while loading a new zone, literally unplayable!!), way too difficult (that’s the point of souls like game, they’re very hard), empty world (I personally disagree, there are plenty of things to find everywhere. You look a bit in a random zone and oh look, and completely optional dungeon for you to explore!), and bad graphics (really? The texture are pretty good, but the art direction is amazing. The overworks looks fantastic). Overall, you should probably listen to the actually reviewers for once and understand that the people giving it a 0 because it doesn’t run at 900 fps at are exaggerating. Pc player with a mid range pc here btw, never once felt like a death was caused by a random lag spike in 10 hours of playtime.

This is a truly insane accomplishment of game design and engineering and I just want to give a kudos to From Software for this game.

And yet it runs terribly, despite the low end graphics... How did the manage that? On PS5 you can't even get stable 60fps in 1080p - simply laughable. And don't make me start about the PC version... You could say - OK, it's not perfect technically, but it's a great souls game. Wrong! It lost all DS atmosphere and it's simply boring... the same stuff over and over again.

MaxWestergaard,"Elden Rings difficulty might not be for everybody, as often souls-borne games are. While people online are complaining about PC issues, 6 of my friends have not had any issues with the game so far. I just completed my first run on the PS5 with a full strength build, and can I just say wow… this game is amazing. This game has over 100 hours of content that don’t utilize recycled content at all. Every single area has new designs, new enemies, and new loot. I don’t understand how people can complain about the graphics, I played the whole game on my TV and I was blown away with how good the game looked. FromSoftware has incorporated new mechanics into the game while keeping the style of the Dark Souls franchise, and even managed small changes to mechanics from old games that offered quality of life changes that just make your life just a tad bit easier. While I will say this game will be too hard for a casual gamer, if you put the time in and don’t get too frustrated when your back is against the wall(I mean to say after you’ve died 100 times to the same boss which happened to me with a couple of them) you will fall in love. Please show love to the creators of this game that spent 5 years of their life for your enjoyment to the this perfect creation, and feel free to take my review and spread it, as there are too many trolls online! Now to start NG+…",10,2022-02-26,PLAYSTATION 5

JOnasx,"As others have said, the world feels a bit empty. The graphics/animations are meh, not something i'd expect on a AAA title on PS5. My biggest complaint with the game is how difficult it is. I'm not someone who has the time to master the intricacies of the rather awkward control systems. There should at least be a difficulty setting for those folks who just want to explore and see the world without literally dying every other encounter. Not everyone has hours a day and patience to try boss fights 30+ times until you figure things out. This game isn't accessible to normal gamers who just want to sit back and have some entertaining evenings on the couch to forget the stress of the day. I really don't get why there isn't a difficulty setting.",5,2022-02-26,PLAYSTATION 5

WhiteDragem,"No spoiler; review by an IT veteran, who has been playing hardcore RPGs since the eighties (pretty much all we had ‘back then’). Important: I am NOT a fan of the ‘SoulsBorne’ style games. When Demon Souls was the PS5 launch title to ‘endure’, I put A LOT of time into that game. and ‘I loved it!’. We could argue some notion of ‘stockholm syndrome’, but this wasn’t the case… The game showed that the project had been a labour of love, with design elements that had been clearly thought about for a ‘very long time’. Everything from level layout to world interaction and ‘gradual introduction’ of certain mechanics and gameplay aspects; this was, quite simply, RPG gaming perfection. Truly it was the best action “D&D” game ever built (and yes, I played Dark Horizon on consoles etc).. The amount of times I wanted to get my players handbooks down from the shelf (and actually did!) to check certain ‘rules’, this game had VERY DEEP RPG mechanics and didn’t spell ANY OF THEM out to the players. Demon Souls was a game that rewarded learning the world, learning the lore, and learning the underlying game play mechanics. (like just about no other RPG has made us do, sans one title in the nineties by Microprose, or a modern ‘built for the masses’ RPG like Divinity:OS.. which isn’t an ‘arcade’ fun factor game.. ). If Demon Souls was the perfect ‘action’ version of an RPG, like in ways that Dungeon Master (1980s) had over Might and Magic (turn based), when this genre started to benefit from the ‘power of computing’; Demon Souls took it to the next level. The lack of ‘hand holding’ was what many gamers probably craved, and few titles would risk their huge investment to deliver to a ‘niche’ market. My only gripe with Demon Souls was ‘one of love’; quite simply - I prefer open world games (when done right).. Now, from a story telling perspective, a linear game has clear advantages, and generally proves a ‘tighter experience for that’, but Demon Souls could only have been improved with potentially ‘more interaction’ (NPCs) and a freedom to just ‘live the world’. So, what happens when the designer of Demon Souls gets to build an open world variant? Gaming perfection! (for a niche group!!) Just like Returnal was the perfect Rogue game (done with a big budget, and pushing ‘cutting edge hardware’), Elden Ring is the perfect HARDCORE RPG game. Except it isn’t perfect: As someone who has been a professional playtester, who understands IT hardware and software intimately, and who optimises everything to within an inch of its’ life; Elden Ring is lacking what some might demand from a console title (locked framerate, and perfect frametime). Note I am playing this game from day one, and at the time of writing this there are a ‘few updates’ and ‘more inbound’ (with some **** acknowledged by the team and the end users).. They did make some odd choices, like using the early z-cull nature of the PS5 customised video chip (that would naturally smash the Xbox platform for an open world title with vegetation in terms of framerates), and they opted to run the game at higher resolution than the competitor platform, likely so as to not get the ire of the Xbox crowd trying to hold on to the notion that their uncustomised (standard PC architecture parts) should somehow be a theoretical ‘improved performance’. (this just isn’t so, and is hard to pull off even for first party studios, even focusing on ‘just one platform’ -unless intentionally GIMPing (Get In Mediocre Performance) software by making design choices that will play poorly on the other companies hardware (we are seeing this a fair bit, and will see it a lot more in the future!!)); so the designers just upped the resolution so as to not have the ‘lesser system’ delivering vastly better framerates ALL THE TIME. (later patches will no doubt deliver a much better balance, and possibly ray tracing and a smooth 30 fps experience). We know the game can do smooth 60fps (ps4 pro version of the code on the PS5) So presently I will not hold back the score of a niche RPG due to performance **** with an OPEN WORLD RPG. Yes; Forza and Horizon Forbidden West both run ‘better’ (neophytes can argue); but the reality is those games are built by first party studios, knowing the capabilities of the hardware intimately, and have squeezed ‘suspension of disbelief’ to pefection. HZD uses 6 time of day cycles to save CPU render budget, vs the realtime lighting in this game.. Destructable objects are heavy hitters and is why killzone Mercenary on a 5 watt PSita looks ‘like’ battlefield on a high end PC. (easier to do, suspends disbelief) This game pushes (niche/hardcore) RPGs forward and is a high watermark for gameplay and immersive world ‘fun’",10,2022-02-26,PLAYSTATION 5

Timenick,"This is by far the best Open World Game you can play on PS5. No generic objectives. Everything is hand-crafted and there is unique stuff to discover everywhere. The landscape is far and diverse and has great verticality. The gameplay is similar to Dark Souls 3 with lots of additional features like jumping, horse riding, stamina breaking, crafting, sewing, and destructible environments for the many open world boss fights against giant enemies. Customization is great and derpy as you expect in a Fromsoftware game. The enemies are epic and horrifying with very interesting and creative looks and designs. It´s very challenging but you can always choose to further explore the open world than being stuck on a boss for hours. There isn´t much story, it is the same obscure apocalyptic lore puzzle like in Dark Souls but the few npc quests are memorable and rewarding. Sound design and music are top notch. The game runs at stable 60fps in performance mode with very few frame drops. Graphics aren´t as good as some PS5 exclusives but the art style and design of the open world and the enemies make more than up for that. Overall a great game and the closest open world to Zelda BotW in terms of diversity and open world design. 10/10",10,2022-02-26,PLAYSTATION 5

How many more times will you use Anor Londo? Even the animations are the same. Also dualsense does not vibrate once. Aren't you ashamed to do this? I don't understand how they give 10 to this game.

Gitpullorigin,"Elden Ring, while retaining the spirit of Souls-like series, strongly reminds me of Morrowind. Not because of the open world, but because of the feeling of the unknown. When you see a monster - you have no idea how deadly it will be. When you see a place - you don't know what to expect and what you will find. When you explore the wilderness - you don't know whether it is a location for your level or whether you have gone somewhere you are not supposed to be. Everything seems dangerous. Everything seems exciting. Everything seems new. That aside, it is very much a FromSoftware game - hard, punishing, rewarding. In many aspects, it is very similar to the Dark Souls series with some interesting twists on it and a lot of quality of life improvements around the multiplayer experience (which worked from day 1, how cool is that?). Graphics... as many people rightfully complained, it is not something you would expect from a PS5 game and in some sense it is even losing to Dark Souls 3. But hey, this review is coming from a guy who plays lots of indie games and will gladly sacrifice graphics for a game which is fun to play, so that is not a concern for me personally.",10,2022-02-26,PLAYSTATION 5

Jimz,"Adding an open world to the dark souls concept made it even better. Had my doubts in how they were gonna make an open world work in this kind of game but they succeeded beyond my expectations. Really enjoyed the addition of mounted combat and faster, easier traversal through your mount that's able to double jump. Its dark souls in bigger better package which can't go wrong. Pretty sad to see ppl who've heard about dark souls in the past give horrible reviews because they heard open world and expected GTA or Far Cry, complaining about trivial things they personally don't like or even about it being too similar to dark souls, even tho all From games work this way. Which of all could be seen in trailers way before release, so there's really no excuse. And i doubt the majority of them even bought the game. If you enjoy dark souls games or just punishing but fair games, i highly recommend this.

The first few hours of this game are good. The bosses are just as difficult as souls games though and require multiple tries for some of them. The one good thing is you can just leave a boss fight and go do other things. Great exploration and I’m sure I’m missing a ton of things. The combat is a bit clunky.

It is a shame that fromsoft continues to use the same outdated engine for their games. Sure dark souls was fun for a little bit but I’m honestly surprised how they can recreate dark souls so many times with no one seeming to care. The combat in elden ring is fine, but we’ve seen it one too many time IMO. However, the open world is not very well designed in terms of terrain and environmental diversity either. The AI is as bad as it’s always been and the animations still look outdated and janky despite playing fairly responsive. Bosses are cool occasionally but there’s nothing in this game to write home about. It’s all been done before and this game simply had too many issues to forgive. I have no idea why it is being rating as one the best games of all time, but to each their own I guess.",4,2022-02-26,PLAYSTATION 5

Dewelwield,"Alright I making this review because it feels like this game is getting review bombed. I’ve been scrolling down the reviews and have seen plenty of 1 and 2 scores siting “bad graphics” “old gameplay” and “poor optimization”. Now while graphics are nothing special in the game, the art style if fantastic. There have been scenes in the game that actually made me use the capture button for the first time in a single player game. (And I’ve played red dead) besides, since when have graphics or old animation been good enough grounds to give a game a 1. Now couple that with optimization problems and ok, you have a point… if there were actually any major issues. This is the ps5 version of the game, not the pc version. I’ve seen the pc version, and while not unplayable, it certainly could be better. But on ps5, the game runs phenomenal. I haven’t had a single frame drop or stutter at any point in roughly 15 hours, granted I am only at the beginning. But if it stays even remotely as consistent as it has into the late game, then I really don’t see any reason to complain. There has been pop in in the distance, but nothing that I could really say ruins the game. And finally, for the bad/dated gameplay… Git gud. Seriously though, this is a from soft game. You knew what you were getting into. If you have a problem with bosses being able to kill you in 2 hits, that’s fine. but please, stop giving these games a 1 because you can’t beat margit the fell. This is a hard game, we all know this, but it’s also the kind of game that if you continue trying, continue fighting, you will eventually persevere. That’s why we all play these games, and especially with Elden ring, you don’t even have to slam your head against the same boss over and over. If one fight is giving you trouble, go off the other way and fight something else. You aren’t limited on your options anymore, and that’s what makes this game stand out from the previous souls games. Yes, it plays like dark souls but open world. But did it really have to be anything else? The world design is like Zelda botw, but with far less empty space. And the combat is similar to ds3, but still different enough to stand on its own. And even if it was identical to ds3… that’s still dark souls 3 combat. That’s not a bad combat system to follow. Just please stop giving it a 1 because it’s not sekiro. Well in summary cause I know y’all just skipped straight to the end, this game really doesn’t deserve all the 1s it’s getting.

Refnix,"To start this off, I am not a fan of the Soulsborne formula and if you feel the same way than this game most likely is not for you. After the overwhelmingly positive reviews of the media, with Elden Ring being called ""Genre defining and a Masterpiece"", I really wanted to give the game a chance and experience it for myself. First and foremost the only genre that it is defining is the Soulsborne genre and I think they made a very good transition from an very linear game design to an open world game. So job well done. Soulsborne fans pretty much have to love it. That is also why I give it a 7. But thats actually it ... there is nothing new in here and nothing that it does better than other well known open world games ... actually it does many things worse. Feels at times really hollow, empty and slow. The graphics are ok, but really nothing to praise, the animations are also pretty okish but look like something from 5 - 10 years ago. Interaction with the world, as in plants that move when you run through them, is non existent ... they just clip through your body. Can't say much about the performance on my PC it ran well. So to cut this down -> you like Soulsborne games? Get it right now Soulsborne games are not your thing? -> maybe give it a try on steam and if you really don't like it ... refund it.",7,2022-02-26,PLAYSTATION 5

The Gameplay is top notch boss battles keeps you at the edge of your seat and certainly incredibly fun! Graphics are jaw dropping and music is so good.

entropy4,"Signed up just to review this game because I'm getting tired of critics overhyping games simply based on the developers. Coming from an avid fan of open world games who has not played many other From Software titles, I struggle to see how this game deserves such a high rating. The graphics are mediocre for next gen consoles. Framerates are poor. Movement and mechanics are clunky. The art is generic and the story is non-existent. The only way I can see why people love this game is the challenge of the bosses and dungeons. But if you're not the type of person who enjoys dying to the same enemy 20 times in a row (I'm not), then there's much here to enjoy. This is basically a mediocre open world game with incredibly difficult and epic boss fights. Nothing more. It's mildly fun. I'd normally give it a 6/10, but given the amount of hype going on in the gaming media, I feel like I need to counterbalance here and am instead giving it a 4/10. Probably won't finish it.",4,2022-02-26,PLAYSTATION 5

There are literally secret encounters everywhere on this map, from dungeons to little villages with a HUGE variety in enemy type. I have only played about 5 hours.

Fabaloro,"Elden Ring es la evolucion de From Software hacia la grandeza, despues de este no se que puedo esperar. Es juego que cumple totalmente con las expectativas e inculso las sobrepasa. Utiliza muy bien el mundo abierto a su favor ya que todo es explorable y genera curiosidad y misterio con su misticismo. Las mecanicas son la evolucion de sus antecesores con lo cual tenemos una jugabilidad de alta calidad. El caballo es una gran incorporacion ya que puede darnos combates cabalgando sobre Torrentera, incluso muchos enemigos se facilitan si combatimos montados sobre este. Otra cosa genial, es como podemos moldear nuestro personaje a gusto, con una gran variedad de armas, hechizos e invocaciones. Si hay algo por lo que siempre se destacaron son las opciones en las que podes enfrentarnos a los Jefes. Los enemigos son duros y este juegos es un reto, pero con voluntad, paciencia y centrandote en la exploracion para luego avanzar en la trama podras evolucionar a tu personaje para hacer el juego mas accecible y disfrutable. Hay una gran cantidad de enemigos por todo el mapa y eso extraordinario. Es verdad, la potencia o calidad grafica no es algo nunca antes vista ni altisima pero si hay algo que siempre nos va a garantizar FromSoftware es que su apartado artisitco es increible y este si que deslumbra.

MathiasBS,"I’m an avid From Software player, having beaten all their previous Soulsborne games. I’m currently 8 hours into Elden Ring, and I think it’s great. It’s basically Dark Souls with some Sekiro and Bloodborne elements, set in an open world. However, as some of the more critical people are stating, I agree that the open world is actually TOO big for it’s own good. Even though the dungeons are super neat, I feel like I spend too much time riding around aimlessly on horseback looking for secrets. There is a lot of secrets to find though, but there’s also plenty of big empty areas littered with ruins that look like they could be explorable, but they are not. The horse combat also holds it back a little; when riding a horse, many of the bosses and enemies in the open world becomes very easy and requires little skill, which I think is a shame. Having just finished Sekiro before this, I also feel like that combat is a step back in terms of clunkyness. That being said, it’s still really good and the sense of discovery and wonder is amazing. Not a 10/10 in my book (so far), but still a damn good game.",8,2022-02-26,PLAYSTATION 5

The narrative is better delivered (you don't have to hunt for it to find it), the color pallet manages to still remain grim without being *grey*. The artists did not shy away from showing beauty in this world in addition to the darkness. The addition of the various methods of fast travel and your spectral steed are fantastic.

The graphics could be better, physics and animations are very poor, considering the recent high quality games, NPC’s animations during conversations not exist. It is a joke! Sound FX are below average and repetitive. As Link the character can’t speak, combat is not responsive, story is too weak. Really a LAZY job.

NamelessHer,"This is definitely the best game I have ever played. From software didn't disappoint me. The world design is excellent. You would find much content by exploration, yet the world still feels big and open, instead of being flooded by many trivial populations. The enemies and encounters are the most difficult among the entire SoulsBorneSekiro series. However, there are more checkpoints to reduce repeated travel time so that you can challenge the difficult bosses more conveniently. Enemy behaviors are very dynamic. They would do a lot of actions based on the player's actions, which provide both opportunity and risk. The only flaw I see is the tutorial phase. At the very first 30 to 60 mins there are many tutorials but not enough content. It felt a bit dull during that period.",10,2022-02-26,PLAYSTATION 5

Graphically it doesn't feel like a next gen experience. The game has performance issues, the framerate is not stable a lot... which impacts the gameplay quite a bit. The controls feel dated, O does the backstep, roll and sprint (which feels like it has a second of lag... which is annoying). The open world is pretty empty, but exploring is fun.

Bustweiser,12 hours in and I’m not even close to being done. Do not worry about optimization that’s really only on pc and somewhat on Xbox. The ps5 is the best way to play and oh my god is it a masterpiece of gaming. You can do what you want at any time you want. It is difficult yes but manageable it just takes time. The people complaining about it being too hard just don’t have enough patience. It’s not a copy paste of Ds3 the people only played like 3 minutes of Both games. It’s a great game. The optimization IS NOT A PROBLEM ON PS5. The people talking about it are probably talking about the pc port. They just don’t realize they are on the ps5 copy of the game,10,2022-02-26,PLAYSTATION 5

OnlyOneHere,"This game is a pile of garbage. The greedy developers copied and pasted the same animations from Dark Souls 3. The developers were too cheap and lazy to make new animations. The animations and graphics are very outdated for a next gen AAA $60 game. The AI is incredibly stupid. The developers were too greedy and lazy to make sophisticated AI, so they just gave the enemies too much health in a pathetic attempt at making the game difficult. This formula is getting so old. FromSoftware games aren't even that hard. All it takes to beat their games is learn the enemy patterns, dance around and have patience when attacking. There are clipping issues. I saw a monster's entire head magically go through a solid wall. There is nothing to do in the open world. Just an empty space full of grass, trees, and rocks. That is so boring to explore. Speaking of rocks, I tried jumping off a cliff so I can land on the other cliff, only for my player to get stuck in between and die. This awful bug could have easily been prevented had the developers add climbing mechanics. The developers are so lazy, they can't even add basic climbing mechanics. In what world does a modern AAA open world game lack climbing mechanics? That is embarrassing. It gets even more embarrassing when I encounter more game breaking bugs. I called my horse and hopped on It, only for my character to magically float in the air and stay stuck there to die. I experienced this bug multiple times. The physics are a joke. The plants don't even react to your movement, a basic feature many modern open world AAA games have. Even indie developers add that feature. The PvP multiplayer is complete trash and unbalanced. I had a player kill me, only because they had a character 20 times more powerful than mines. This game gets more unfair when I had an enemy AI killing me with a spear that was 5 inches away from my face. The game punishes me for terrible and lazy game design. $60 is too expensive for this poor expensive ****. It is recycled trash and a cash grab. I don't recommend this game at all.",0,2022-02-26,PLAYSTATION 5
pstunner,Update after 41 hours: Poor performance still not resolved and still frustrating. Further you progress in the game the more the flaws appear.
